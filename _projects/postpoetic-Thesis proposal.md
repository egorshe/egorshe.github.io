# Summary

The overall goal of my dissertation, provisionally titled "Postpoetic
Soviet Baltic Documentaries of the 1980s: The Aesthetics of
Disappearance," is to study the late-Soviet postpoetic documentary
cinema and its modes of production and circulation through an
examination of documentaries produced in the Baltic Soviet republics
(Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania) throughout the 1980, and to analyze this
body of work produced in the 1980s leading up to the dissolution of the
USSR. In my analysis, an issue of geographical formations becomes
important on macro and micro levels. On the one hand, the whole
cinematic industry was subordinated to the Soviet state: three
republican film studios (Tallinnfilm, Riga film studio, and Lithuanian
film studio in Vilnius) were well-equipped by the provided financing and
technical means from Moscow. The industry was embedded into a planned
economy which meant that every film had to be pitched to the studios'
management and approved by several committees including *Glavlit*[^1] in
Moscow for motion pictures longer than 40 minutes. On the other hand,
filmmakers established close connections with their colleagues from the
*sister* republics both on official (symposiums and festivals) and
semi-official (annual visits, initiated by the filmmakers themselves, to
screen their films for the colleagues and gather feedback). Considering
that the filmmakers used different documentary methods and were involved
in the production not of a homogeneous but of a hybrid documentary
genre, I argue that these filmmakers historiographically and
aesthetically have formed a coherent movement that inherited a poetic
tradition of the Soviet cinema of the 1960s.

The purpose of my historical research is to preserve and interpret the
socio-political practices and cultural and political events that led to
a collapse of the Soviet empire on the Western borderlands. A particular
problematic of such a research is grounded in the lacking of a common
balanced view on historical events that happened with the Baltic states
while being incorporated in the Soviet Union. In my thesis, I
theoretically question the very imaginary geographical formations
(Soviet space, USSR, Baltic republics, *Pribaltika*[^2]). Despite the
fact that this dissertation is divided into chapters each of which
focuses on one of the three Baltic republics, its specificity and
uniqueness, I will try to trace and highlight links among local film
studios and professionals. A relocation of this subjective position
within the Baltic region is, of course, a part of the theoretical
questions raised in the dissertations. This is a question not only about
circulation and distribution but about the geographical and
epistemological scale itself. The notion of the Baltics in the
dissertation is questioned from both geopolitical perspective and
perspective of the local cultures. These relations between physical and
political geographies are important to me and to the authors and auteurs
whose bodies of work I analyze. By referring to the *Baltics* as a
specific entity I am stressing the ambiguous nature of this geographical
space. While there is an ongoing struggle of Estonian, Latvian, and
Lithuanian societies against the neo-colonial label "Eastern Europe"
assigned to the republics by global discourses, the question of spatial
and political positioning has a deeper history. The intimacy of the
people who share the space, a special combination of space and the body
that had to structure local contexts in the Soviet era experienced what
Homi Bhabha calls the "outsideness of the inside" ---\"an invasion of
exteriority or alterity into the intimate spaces of one\'s
subjectivity," as Epp Annus applies it to the analysis of the Soviet
Baltic everyday life (Annus 2018, 206). Thus, I intentionally merge
three geographical contexts into a single body to emphasize the
problematiс status of the Baltic region within the USSR and to question
integral issues related to postcolonial question in relation to the
Baltic states and the politics of disappearance of the Soviet politics
and poetics in the post-Soviet contexts. In the dissertation, I propose
to theorize these issues in the sphere of documentary cinema through the
concept of *postpoetics*.

I use the term "postpoetic" to identify the specific examples of the
temporal, spatial, political, and aesthetic sensibility I analyze in
this dissertation. As distinguished from Baltic poetic cinema, which is
recognized and institutionally accepted[^3], postpoetic cinema, as I
conceived it and deployed it, does not refer to any specific movement or
school of filmmaking, but rather to the documentary aesthetic
itself---its "documentality." I developed the term postpoetic, and
propose to use it, for several reasons. First, because it reflects a
specific period of the Soviet history that comes after the Thaw era of
the late 1950s-1960s characterized by romanticism, humanism, and
optimism in popular culture and a reduction of a repressive nature of
the regime, such as release of significant number of political
prisoners. The term postpoetic then delineates the boundaries of the
period of stagnation during the rule of Breznev, Andropov, and
Chernenko\--the two subsequent leaders of the USSR, representatives of
the extreme conservative-wing of the party---and the beginning of
Perestroika---a political movement for reformation within the Communist
Party. Second, the term postpoetic indicates the new epistemology,
rooted in the experiences of the political transformations within the
Soviet society of the 1980s and national movements in the Baltic region.
Postpoetic in an epistemological sense highlights the development of the
late-Soviet poetics, aesthetics, and politics in the distance to
ideological centers of the Soviet state and uncovers alternative
circulatory networks of the Baltic documentary film community such as
the documentary film symposium held in Jurmala, Latvia every second year
since 1977, organized by filmmaker Ivars Seleckis and film theoreticians
and critics Ābrams Kleckins and Miks Savisko, or more frequent visits of
the Baltic filmmakers by the neighbors organized by local offices of
*Dom Kino* (House of the Cinema), headquarters of the Soviet\
Filmmakers\' Union.

In this thesis, I propose to use term postpoetic for several reasons.
First, in a constructivist sense, postpoetic cinema will be analyzed as
an integral stage of the evolution of Soviet poesis, from Russian
futurism/formalism to Socialist art to Khruschev's Thaws, Stagnation and
finally Perestroika. Methodologically, it questions and problematizes
the very notion of the institutionally recognized poetical cinema of the
1960-1970s and its place within the wide poetical tradition in art and
literature of the Thaw. Epistemologically, it scrutinizes how
postpoetic's sensitivity as a method provided the filmmakers with a tool
to inscribe their own stories into the larger transnational traumatic
history.

Speaking about *poetics* in *postpoetic,* I plan to rationalize this
methodology by appealing to approaches of Russian formalism---a school
of literary criticism emerged in the 1910s. The school had survived
during the October Revolution and was involved in the intellectual
metamorphosis that occurred later in the 1920s. Inspired by the futurism
and the critique of cult of masterpieces in academic art, Victor
Shklovsky, together with poet and critic Roman Jakobson, created a
theoretical school based on the idea of researching not for the
emotional response to a piece of art but for the structure of this
object. Shklovsky identified the world of perception through the clash
of two epistemological strategies: poetic speech and ordinary speech
(prose). The first category refers to the ability to give meaning to the
world, to see an image behind every word. The latter, is applied to the
routine communication and the process of turning a word into a concept,
prose is "economical, easy, correct" (Shklovsky, 12); poetic language
obeys the laws of expenditure that coordinate with a texture of a poetic
text, prosaic language, on the contrary, represents an economy of
energy. Working through Shklovsky's notion of *defamiliarization* (as if
seen for the first time) will enable this pertinent methodology to think
about poetry and poesis in relation to the Baltic documentary cinemas as
a transmedia transformation from poetical dominative protoforms of
tones, rhythms, and pauses to the particular type of augmented reality
and fragmented visuality in the 1980s' documentaries.

Shklovsky's theory of defamiliarization (*ostranenie*, estrangement, as
is rendered in more recent translations) combined with Brecht's
alienation effect[^4] as the way to experience Marxist alienation but
without losing a natural spontaneity (ingenuousness) seems particular
useful in order to relocate Alexei Yurchak's anthropological methodology
in the studying of the last Soviet generation through the
conceptualization of the core concept of his 2006 book *Everything Was
Forever, Until It Was No More*---*being vnye* (outsideness). Yurchak
describes the specific experience of simultaneously being a part of the
Soviet system and thus participating in ideological bureaucratic rituals
and accomplish a *performative shift,* which is a reproduction of the
form of the rituals but not their content. While describing the state of
*being vnye*, Yurchak explicates and contextualizes late-Soviet
subjectivity as not characterized by the term stagnation, which is a
common name used to delineate the period of Brezhnev leadership in
1964---early 1980s, but as a period of implicit transformations within
historical and cultural generations. The scholar transfers the concept
from literary criticism to the debates about different modes of
interaction with the political and ideological part of the state. In my
thesis, I propose to perform a reconstruction of this shift and bring
the analysis of late-Soviet subjectivity in the Baltic States back to
the debates in correlation to Baltic literary situation, Ranciere's *le
partage du sensible*, formalist notion of estrangement, and postcolonial
theory to problematize the understanding of Baltic subaltern
subjectivity in the late period of USSR's history. For that reason, it
is important to relocate the idea of the Soviet subjectivity from a
historiographical and linear understanding of historical and conceptual
universals and narratives towards an anthropological approach that
scrutinizes the societies and communities in the attempt to reveal a
specific form of the cultural configurations.

Recent postcolonial tendencies in film and media studies provide
fundamental tools to analyze the emerged tension in the history of
media. Multidisciplinary methodological discussion in the field between
historians and film scholars resulted in a new conception of cinema,
where cinema is manifested as a multi-layered and complex sociocultural
industrial, political, institutional, and ideological phenomenon. Over
the past few decades after the dissolution of the USSR, film scholars
have made a notable contribution to our knowledge of Eastern and Central
European cinema of the former Eastern Bloc (Golding 1989, Imre 2005,
Portuges and Hames 2013, Mazierska et al. 2014, Bahun and Haynes 2014).
However, the thriving cinema tradition of the Baltic States continues to
be neglected in contemporary English-language scholarship. Baltic
national cinema movements of the 1960-1980s have always been looked at
under the umbrella of *Soviet* cinema (Horton and Brashinsky 1992,
Beumers 2007), ignoring the cultural landscapes in the region, as well
as the conflicts of identity within the ongoing renegotiations of past
and present inside Baltic society. National Baltic cinemas under Soviet
rule remained foreign to both the English and Russian speaking academy.

Bringing a concept of "estrangement" to the analysis of cinematic
reconfigurations of the 1980s has another methodologically motivated
reason. In the past decades, there is a new dichotomy of thinking about
"estrangement." Some contemporary authors address this concept from the
perspective of a distance, comparing this notion with an idea of
detachment and isolation (Slobin 2005) or exile (Ruttenburg 2005). On
the other hand, Svetlana Boym connects Shklovsky's estrangement with the
idea of freedom (Boym 1994). For Boym, estrangement of the routine
becomes a characteristic of the Soviet everydayness. It becomes a
freedom of the artificial behavior---a device that now should be
uncovered and which has to be hidden after the Stalinist's 1930s come
into the place. Boym recovers "estrangement" as a theoretical method
while speaking about (post)Perestroika's times and connects it with the
notions of nostalgia and intimacy (sincerity of the 1990s). Drawing on
the example of Russian-Soviet avant-garde poet Dmitrii Prigov she
defines his "new sincerity" as "at once an act of defamiliarization and
of unadmitted nostalgia for a certain kind of pure-hearted and naive
first-person discourse that escapes multiple narrative framings and
scaffoldings; indeed, it is not a discourse at all, but pure-heartedness
itself-something that may have never existed in its ideal pure form."
(102)

Following Boyms impulse of re-articulation of the idea of "estrangement"
when analyzing cultural reconfigurations of the 1980s and 1990s, I
propose to question the current historical antagonism of Soviet
revolution and Perestroika's counter-revolution as an exemplary
opposition that obscures a comprehensive understanding of the cultural
processes of the epoch. Instead, I argue that it is due to the appeal to
Revolutionary devices that Baltic documentary filmmakers were able to
create a unique aesthetics that mediated the explosion of reality to the
Soviet screen. Mediated in a revolutionary way, opposing the old myth of
the Great October Revolution with its own myth of a widely shared
belated postmemory re-narrated and re-represented in the Singing
Revolution of the late 1980s. Therefore, estrangement as a method can be
applied not only from a historical perspective as a way to
re-contextualize narrative reduction of a revolutionary cultural
production, but as a theoretical method that uncovers relationship
between form and content both in cinema and social relations (Yurchak
2013). Alexei Yurchak has elaborated on the evolution of a socialist
ritual during the late-Socialist period. In this dissertation, I suggest
that returning to the polemic within formalist methodology and
complementing these debates with post-colonial theory as well as
Ranciere's approach to aesthetics is a productive way of thinking about
Baltic postpoetic documentary from the perspectives of time, space, and
institutional and cultural mechanisms of subjectifications within
late-Soviet reconfigurations of memory.

Moreover, the history of the late-Soviet Baltic documentary cinema is
still not written. Institutional demarcation between media and art also
guides contemporary academic studies. Soviet Latvian poetry, Lithuanian
photography, and Estonian late-Soviet postmodern art are the research
objects that continue to exist in different intellectual context: from
the Kantian figure of *genius* to the idea of art as an internal
migration or a dissident gesture. At the same time, positioning cinema
within the state apparatus emphasised the ideological and propaganda
aspects of films, rather than their artistic and creative dimensions.
The still-present trauma of the post-Soviet condition of the Baltic
states and the fact that the whole cinema industry was subordinated to
the state apparatus prevents any significant debates on the role of
documentary cinema in production of the national discourses that
contributed to the processes of subjectification within local societies.

The above-mentioned scholars Svetlana Boym and Alexei Yurchak have
enriched our knowledge about the everyday life in the Soviet country,
however, they are not completely adequate for the understanding of
late-Soviet cinema cultures. My project aims to combine an attention to
Soviet everyday life and analysis of aesthetical transformations within
Baltic documentary cinema in order to draw attention to this unique
cinematic phenomenon---postpoetic Baltic documentary---in a situation
when these authors and their films are being neglected within the
post-Cold war and post-socialist debates. There is still no adequate
language which can be used, for example by local Baltic educators and
film festivals' programme directors[^5], to speak about late-Soviet
documentaries produced in the Baltic states. The situation of the two
conflicted models of national and Soviet is still present and cannot be
solved in the context of the growing geopolitical tensions in the
region. My goal is to overcome the pathos of both nostalgic/patronizing
and sovietphobic paradigms and to map out a theoretical approach that
will elucidate a unique phenomenon of the postpoetic cinema that emerged
in a bewildering labyrinth of the late-Soviet reality.

My initial assessment of postpoetic cinema starts with the
identification and exploration of a series of key points: the
construction and transformation of national discourses through
non-violent anti-imperial struggles; the genealogies of postpoetic
cinema from avant-garde formalist experiments of the 1920s to the poetic
cinema of the 1960s[^6]; the political, cultural, and social functions
of propaganda newsreels and other documentary films made for Baltic
publics; the emergence of witnessing subjects in postpoetic cinema and
its involvement in the construction of memory of national trauma; the
political and ideological aspects in the documenting of the everyday
life and reconstruction of Baltic nations within Soviet narratives; and
the attributes of the last Soviet generation from the perspective of
both its specific cultural configuration and its mechanisms of social
dynamics.

Keeping in mind these key historical and societal frameworks, the main
objectives of this project are twofold. The first goal is to explore the
interactions of place, identity, politics, and memory in documentary
cinema during the decade of the collapse of the Soviet regime in the
Baltic States. I will use the division of the *political* into *policy*
and *emancipation* as defined by Ranciere (1992) to outline the
distinctions between different types of political documentary. According
to Jacques Rancière, "political" is a product of two processes, one of
which he calls "policy," and the other \"emancipation," or "politics."
Policy is the process of "governing, and it entails creating community
consent," which "relies on the distribution of shares and the hierarchy
of places and functions;" emancipation instead is \"a set of practices
guided by the supposition that everyone is equal and by the attempt to
verify this supposition." (Ranciere 1992, 58) The encounter of these two
processes composes the political. Additionally, if the first process
relates to the "citizen" and the second one to the "person", then the
political deals with the problematization of both these concepts. In his
2005 book *The Politics of Aesthetics,* Jacques Ranciere conceptualizes
an approach to the understanding of sensibility, in which he disagrees
with the approach of Alain Badiou. Badiou considers aesthetics as a
unity of transcendence and immanence: "Art is a thought in which
artworks are the Real (and not the effect)." (Badiou 2005, 9) Ranciere,
however, approaches a concept of aesthetics through a matter of social
and collective transformations. An aesthetics, for Ranciere, is a
specific mode of sensibility and intelligibility. His main idea that
aesthetics invariably recreates a new collectivity through a
distribution (reorientation) of the sensible. Aesthetics, according to
Ranciere, is a global phenomenon that could be seen as a totality. In
this way he contrasts it to the logic of the modernist project that
emerged in the beginning of the twentieth century. The logic within
modernism is subordinated to theology[^7], the belief in the reliable
meaning of the human history. Thus, modernist logics build on consensus
(ideals, canons, values). In contrast, dissensus is a "conflict between
a sensory presentation and a way of making sense of it"; it is driven by
contingency and public anonymity (139). That is why Ranciere
distinguishes cinema and photography, both of which are able to notice
invisible details of the ordinary---to estrange. So, as if quoting
Shklovsky, Ranciere writes, "the ordinary becomes a trace of the true if
it is torn from its obviousness in order to become a hieroglyph, a
mythological or phantasmagoric figure" (34). Therefore, an aesthetics,
for Ranciere, is a medium that keeps dissensus active. Dissensus breaks
the dichotomy of the spectator and the artwork. It cancels the division
between the visible and the real and emancipates the spectator from the
hierarchical structures (Ranciere 2008). To apply this thesis to the
objects of this dissertation, dissensus of the postpoetic documentary
liberates itself from the hierarchies of the socialist realist dogmas
and reconstitutes an aesthetics as a collective phenomenon without
reducing a discourse into a dialogue between art and subjects of power.
This theoretical maneuver allows for Ranciere to identify an aesthetics
as a metadiscourse of art and politics and to retrieve a dissensus from
power relations. Therefore, Ranciere's theory of aesthetics is a
fruitful theoretical framework for analysis of organization of
subjectivity within postpoetic cinema of the 1980s. This disciplinary
approach focuses on non-individual sensibility and expands theorizations
on subjectivity from the limited concepts of subject-object
relationships toward complex aesthetic spheres of unity and diversity,
public and private. This methodology seems to me particularly applicable
to the analysis of processes of reconfiguration occurred in postpoetic
documentary in the Baltic countries.

Second, I propose to reconceptualize the problematics of subjectivity
during the final periods of the USSR by using an
anthropologically-inspired method that allows me to historicize
generations that, in turn, reveals the multiple cultural and political
configurations of subjectifications. This mode of analysis reveals the
late-Soviet mechanisms of social mimicry that allowed for the Soviet
people--not to reject the great Socialist project--to start to build new
types of independent horizontal relations, thus turning the private
sphere into a political realm. In this regard, I will challenge the
popular concept of *Homo Sovieticus* as an average socialist subject
lacking identity and self-respect. (Fitzpatrick 2000) Based on the
binary construct between *oppression* and *resistance*, such an approach
narrows the study of late-Soviet subjectivity to a *repression vs.
freedom* model. In opposition to this binary construct of antagonism
between *oppression* and *resistance*, socio-cultural anthropologist
Alexei Yurchak in his 2006 book developed an alternative conceptual
model of understanding relations between the Soviet system and people
who lived in it. Through deconstruction of a stereotypical *middlebrow
vs. dissident* dualistic pattern Yurchak traces the other forms of
community, language, and discourse and builds an ambivalent approach to
understanding of forms of the Soviet subjectivity. I propose that while
working through issues of witnessing trauma through documentary image,
postpoetic cinema developed a conceptual configuration that addressed
the dynamic landscape of Perestroika and revealed, as Moore puts it,
specific decolonial desire to "return to Western-ness that once was
theirs" (Moore 2001) and escape from the collapsing Soviet Empire

At the historiographical level, my research will scrutinize the Baltic
documentary cinema of the 1980s as an independent generational concept
that incorporated ideological, cultural, and transnational facets in the
nexus of everyday aesthetics. Methodologically, my project intends to
address these problems by using an eclectic approach to the analysis of
Baltic postpoetic cinema and late-Soviet subjectivities, where different
subjective positions in socialist society are looked at within multiple
ideological discourses, and therefore rejecting the binary model
promoted by modern *Sovietology* (Groys 2010, Yurchak 2006). In order to
do this, my dissertation focuses on representational spaces, political
non-violent struggles (Eglitis 2005), modes of production and
circulation, and interactions in everyday life (Cresswell 1996) with
regard to the Baltic postpoetic documentaries from both national
(national past, identities, and belongings) and transnational (Eastern
European socialist film schools) perspectives.

At the same time, focusing on the scholarship in the field of Baltic
Studies on research of movements and not generations, producing a
comparative research of Baltic poetic schools and their Western siblings
(Cinéma vérité, Direct Cinema, French New Wave) ignores the complicated
nature of social relations between subaltern periphery and dominant
center within Soviet Empire. Thus, it results in the loss of a massive
heritage of many filmmakers whose work is now forgotten.

My dissertation does not ground the research of the Baltic documentary
cinema as a study of isolated single nation traditions. On the contrary,
in this thesis I will reveal and stress the relation between local film
industries and the Soviet cultural authorities. Dina Iordanova in her
article, or as she calls it herself, "reaction to the incident \[of the
cinemas of the newly independent former Soviet republics being covered
in the BFI's companion\]" (Iordanova 2005, 230) accentuates the
structural problem of the debates on *rediscovering* of the *emerging*
or *nascent* (Ibid, 244) cinemas after disappearing from the Cold-War
set-ups. Iordanova advocates scholars and researchers and indicates that
these are the academic publishers who dictate the framework for a
topo-temporal exploration of the cultural histories of small nations.
However, it needs to be said that the other side of the confrontation,
as described by Iordanova, is also involved in this politics of
memorialization.

Another most recent example that again indicates a related structural
issue around the idea mapping Soviet Baltic cinema within the larger
European cultural history is 2018 film *Bridges of Time*. The authors of
the film---a major event in the Baltic documentary industry putting
together an extensive set of key works of poetic documentary films from
the Baltic region---tend to represent the Baltic poetic cinema in line
with the French pioneers of *cinéma vérité* and direct cinema in
Québec.[^8] This comparison, while allowing Baltic documentary cinema of
the 1960s-1970s to being included in a global historiography, is not
always adequate. For example, the notion of *unmediated existence* (Hall
1991), a traditional characteristic of cinema verite and direct cinema,
usually associated with the new technology of synchronized sound
recording which made possible "a new privileged grasp of reality."
(Waugh 1976, 235), does not apply to the Baltic case. According to
Estonian historian Riho Västrik, access of filmmakers from the Baltic
republics to synchronous sound recording technology (*Nagra* or it
analogues) was extremely limited and could barely have any effect on the
development of the poetic style of Baltic documentary.[^9] Likewise, the
impulse to collate the aesthetics of some Baltic documentaries of the
period with the Astruc's concept of the *camera-stylo*, which
"break\[s\] free from the tyranny of what is visual, from the image for
its own sake, from the immediate and concrete demands of the narrative,
to become a means of writing just as flexible and subtle as written
language" (Astruc 1968), is especially alluring if we tend to understand
the *poetic* as *romantic* and *metaphorical*, tempting to understand
Baltic poetic documentary cinema as an attempt to escape from the
totalitarian system of oppression through the artistic alienation.
However, and this is one of the core assumptions of this thesis, I
propose that Baltic postpoetic documentary cinema of the 1980's, along
with its precursor embodied in poetic school, while not being fully
insulated from the global aesthetic and technological transformations,
is a distinctive phenomenon that developed its own language to address
the issue of memory, trauma, colonization, and subjectivity within the
socialist mode of cinema production.

Finally, by addressing the topics of everyday life, postpoetic
documentary filmmakers have demonstrated how it is possible to outwit
the capacity of state censorship. Speaking about postpoetic cinema as a
new kind of language, this project intends to analyze the concept of
*subjectification* through the process of transgression, which is
essential when mapping the boundaries of authoritative discourse in the
Soviet Union. In this sense, trauma studies and its main object---the
traumatized subject--becomes a new kind of contemporary identity that
witnesses and captures the disappearing past and reveals a new kind of
cultural politics (Bennett and Kennedy 2003). The discourse of trauma
creates a bridge between memory discourse and the discipline of
historiography. Drawing on Cathy Caruth's study of "unclaimed
experience" (2006), this project identifies the figure of the witness
who is inseparable from its object. Combining this view with Yurchak's
analysis of late-Soviet publics, this project examines how
professionally educated documentary filmmakers in national film
industries and their approach towards filmmaking differed from the
established shooting of newsreels and propaganda materials. These
filmmakers developed an un-institutional and yet coherent cinema
community whose artistic and historic sensibilities unpacked the Soviet
epic narrative. (Pētersone 2012)
