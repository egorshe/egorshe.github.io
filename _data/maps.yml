- title: "Mapping Vilnius Literature"
  image: "/assets/img/maps/Kuncinas_Glisono.jpg"
  description: "The literature of Vilnius is extremely diffused, both linguistically and spatially, which creates a fractured and fragmented sense of the place. This narrative segmentation echoes the geo-cultural dispersal and national divisions of the city, making reading (and writing) Vilnius a perpetual act of translation. Putting Vilnius literature on the map is another form of translation; but while linguistic translations require breaking cultural codes and crossing boundaries, mapping, potentially, makes entering into separate and unique narrative worlds an experiment in building a cohesive yet kaleidoscopic picture-world of the place."
