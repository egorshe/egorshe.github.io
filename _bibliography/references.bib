These identities varied along two distinct but related dimensions: their content and contestation. Nationalist movements throughout post-Soviet Eurasia invoked their nations in support of specific purposes, which frequently cast Russia as the nation's most important “other” and the state from which autonomy and security must be sought. Nationalists therefore offered specific proposals for the content of their societies’ collective identities. But not everyone in these societies shared the priorities of their nationalist movements. Indeed, the international relations among post-Soviet states often revolved around one central question: did post-Soviet societies and politicians agree with their nationalists or not? The former Communists played a decisive role in contesting the content of national identity. One of the defining differences among post-Soviet states during the 1990s was the political and ideological relationship in each one between the formerly Communist elites and the nationalists—whether the former Communists marginalized the nationalists, arrested them, coopted them, bargained with them, or even tried to become like them. These different relationships revealed different degrees and kinds of societal consensus about national identity after Soviet rule.},

Drawing together the field of mainstream postcolonial studies with post-Soviet postcolonial studies and studies of the late Ottoman Empire, the contributors in this volume question many of the concepts and assumptions we have become accustomed to in postcolonial studies, creating a fresh new version of the field. Divided into 3 main sections: Defending the Postcolonial Territory; Political Positions in Light of Unchanged Symmetries; Towards a Multidirectional Approach to the Postcolonial, the contributors look at topics such as humanism, nationalism, multiculturalism, nostalgia and the Anthropocene in order to piece together a new, broader vision for postcolonial studies in the twenty-first century." --},

  abstract = {Russia’s twenty-first-century military aggression has inspired calls for rethinking the Soviet era and its aftermath – for drawing attention to decolonizing efforts within the (former) USSR and to Russia’s colonial practices and imperial aspirations. At the same time, the present era of anthropogenic climate change urges us to consider the global and planetary implications of local actions. This Element combines these two scholarly impulses to consider Soviet-era Estonian society between the 1960s and the 1980s: it investigates how natural environments and social ideas and circumstances were intertwined in fundamental ways, and it emphasizes local agency over homogenizing strategies of Soviet rule. Estonians cared deeply about their local environments, but they also took inspiration from environmentalist works of global importance. Various aspects of Estonian environmental thought and practice are analyzed as tied to local, intimate environments, as impacted by Soviet/Russian colonial rule, and as connected to the global circulation of ideas.},

Our analysis of the Lithuanian public authorities’ discourse throughout the COVID-19 crisis management (2020–2022) asserts that solidarity was employed as a rhetorical technology within the paternalistic governance of the pandemic. In the long run, it became routine and faded away, calling into question the extent to which it could be activated to manage future adversities.},

  abstract = {В статье делается попытка прочертить путь развития эстетики как философской дисциплины от ориентации на чувственное познание к современной художественной практике, выступающей в качестве интеллектуальной критики общества. В таком виде эстетика становится практикой равенства, что уловил еще Кант в своей антиномии вкуса, обнаружив в нем момент «общего чувства» (sensus communis), не сводимого ни к какому индивидуальному проявлению чувственности. Когда sensus communis вводится как основной принцип эстетики равенства, то место философских понятий занимают аффективные образы, воздействующие на публику, и теряется различие между искушенным и наивным восприятием. Подобно революционному энтузиазму масс, это образыдействия, трансверсальные сложившимся институтам, в том числе институтам демократическим, утверждающим равенство как одну из ценностей. Но равенство — не ценность, а именно практический принцип, который, чтобы стать принципом мышления, должен освоить критический потенциал искусства.             The article makes an attempt to trace the path of development of aesthetics as a philosophical discipline from its orientation on sensual cognition to contemporary artistic intellectual critique of society. In this form, aesthetics becomes a practice of equality, a fact which Kant already grasped in his antinomy of taste, discovering in it a moment of sensus communis which is not reducible to any individual manifestation of sensuality. When the sensus communis is introduced as the basic principle of the aesthetics of equality, affective images take the place of philosophical concepts, affecting the public, and the distinction between sophisticated and naïve perception is lost. Like the revolutionary enthusiasm of the masses, these are action-images, transversal to established institutions, including democratic institutions that affirm equality as a value. But equality is not a value; it is a practical principle that needs to master the critical potential of art in order to become a principle of thinking.},

In the late 1920s, factography’s leader Sergei Tret’iakov arrived at a pragmatic turn in his practice of “operative factography”, similar to what occurred later in philosophy of language. Analyzing this selfreflexive and self-critical literary practice from the perspectives of narratology and post-formalist micro-sociology, it is proposed that estrangement (“ostranenie”) is intrinsic to the very act of utterance.},

Автор анализирует контекст публикации, появившейся, когда Горбачев и его команда готовили революционную политическую реформу. Рассматриваются язык, аргументы и жанр текста, который, отвечая конвенциям жанра «письма в редакцию», предлагал себя в качестве установочного текста, задающего новую линию партии. Борьба, развернувшаяся после попытки Егора Лигачева использовать текст для ограничения влияния Александра Яковлева на прессу, в контексте подготовки Горбачевым радикальной реформы привела к ряду непредвиденных последствий, включая два дня обсуждений в Политбюро и переход от режима управляемой гласности к свободе слова, к которой не был готов ни один из участников.},

It draws on a survey that the author has conducted over the past several months of 30 such authors. Fifteen respondents, who during the war have opted to withdraw from their main language of creativity in favour of another, are compared to a second group of 15 respondents, who continue using Russian as their language of creativity. The article engages with these authors’ reflections and reasoning as to why they have given up (or not given up) the Russian language in favour of Ukrainian, and it offers some considerations on the sociopolitical implications of making (or declining to make) such a switch, as well as questions of self-decolonization, linguistic affiliation, and sociocultural peripheries and marginality.},

  abstract = {The essay discusses the changeable ways in which the subject is indicated by means of the pronoun “we” (“мы”) in contemporary Russian poetry. Although “we” is much less frequently dispensed with as a strategy than “I”, the use of the conventional poetic “we”, which expresses so-called universal thoughts, has greatly diminished. Rather, poets tend to use the first person plural with caution and consciously to avoid it. Embodying the opposition of the public to the private, “we” remains a certain marker of ideology in poetry, especially when it deals with the subjective past. The beginning of the twenty-first century is characterized by persistent introduction of scientific discursive practices into the poetic text, which leads to an increase in use of the author’s scholarly “we”. Contemporary poetry reveals an explicit increase in a motile “we” that does not establish manifest boundaries of the self: the “we” of fear, the “we” of dream, the “we” of flight, etc., which can be united under the term “cognitive we”. This motile “we” accommodates an indefinitely multiple subject and is ultimately expressed as a feminine “we”. This “we” transcends the oppositions of subjectivity vs. non-subjectivity and wholeness vs. disintegration.},

  abstract = {With their geographic and economic dimensions, post-Soviet de facto states are very small structures, yet they have existed for over a quarter of a century. This means that they have already had a generation that has no connection with the mother state from which they have separated. However, because the patron of their independence is (or, in the case of Artsakh, indirectly) Russia, which even officially recognized two of them (Abkhazia and South OssetiaAlania), many authors keep observing their development. Their geopolitical importance significantly increased after the Russian aggression in Ukraine. Unrecognized states cannot be open economies, even if they wanted. In addition, in the case of post-Soviet de facto states, these are underdeveloped economies with high import costs and whose products are characterized by low competitiveness. The submitted contribution focuses on these structures from the point of view of the theory of small states. Based on geographic, demographic, economic and historical indicators, as well as the ability to resist reintegration, they suggest their theoretical possibilities of defending factual independence and gaining wider international recognition. The theory of small states shows in practice that the benefits of "smallness" cannot be used by de facto states to strengthen their political and economic prestige precisely because of the absence of international recognition and the rivalry of large states over geopolitical influence.},

Latvia was subjected to different types of oppression, restriction and control and, as regards translation policy, was dependent on Moscow’s position. To grasp the scale of imperative activities – both conspicuously visible and masterfully veiled – taken by the regime authorities to ensure ideological indoctrination of society, institutional, individual and socio-cultural domains are to be examined and analysed. The present work studies, as an indispensable part of the translation policy implemented under the Soviet rule, important external structures of text – interpretation, facts – as represented in forewords and/or afterwords of Latvian publications of Anglophone literature issued in the years of 1953–1964, during the Khrushchev’s time, which can be characterised by the acute confrontation in the Cold War. To mould Latvians into New Soviet People – collectivistic, patriotic, loyal to the Communist Party –various channels to address the society were exploited. By applying the postcolonial perspective, culture-historical approach, and comparative method the research focuses on examining the ways the translated literature was manipulatively presented and represented in Soviet Latvia aimed at being included in the narrative of constructing a New Soviet Person.},

Every year special thematic section of the conference focuses on cinema, and this time it was dedicated to Juris Podnieks (1950–1992), one of the most important documentary filmmakers of Latvian cinema who would have turned 70 on 5 December 2020. Juris Podnieks began working at the Riga Film Studio at the second half of the 1960s. In 1969, he entered the All-Union State Institute of Cinematography to become a documentary cinematographer. His graduation film was Herz Frank’s full-length documentary “Restricted Area” (Aizliegtā zona, 1975), which he filmed (together with another cinematographer, Sergejs Nikolajevs) at the youth delinquents’ colony in the town of Cēsis. Soon after, in 1977 he made his directorial debut with the newsreel Padomju Latvija/ “Soviet Latvia” (No. 3, 1977, entitled “The Cradle”/ Šūpulis). Since the beginning of the 1980s, Podnieks directed fulllength documentary films, and each of those became a notable artistic achievement and resonated in society. His first full-length film “Constellation of Riflemen” (Strēlnieku zvaigznājs, 1982) told the story of the Latvian riflemen who fought for their country under different regimes in the early 20th century. At the beginning of the film, Podnieks introduces himself and presents the film’s premise. It is still rarely used approach in Latvian documentary at the time, with the filmmaker participating and involving himself actively in the film. It was Podnieks’ subsequent full-length film “Is It Easy to Be Young?”(Vai viegli būt jaunam?, 1986), which made his name known both in the Soviet Union and internationally, and paved the way for international assignments (covered also in the discussion below). This was an unusually honest testimony of young people of the Soviet Latvia, who dared to speak frankly and express their inner feelings and thoughts about the system they lived in. In the film history of the 1980s, this is one of the most important films coming out of the region referenced as signifiers of Gorbachev’s perestroika.1 The strong voice of the filmmaker manifested in “Is It Easy to Be Young?” was the reason for receiving the commission from Central Independent Television that turned into the grand portrait of the falling Soviet Union – a five-part series “Hello, Do You Hear Us?” (Mēs, 1989, title in the USA – “Soviets”). The changing political landscape, fighting for freedom became the theme of Podnieks’ last films – “Homeland” (Krustceļš, 1990), “Post Scriptum” (Pēcvārds, 1991, which includes episodes of Barricades in Riga in January 1991, when his cameraman Gvido Zvaigzne was wounded (and later passed away in the hospital), but Andris Slapiņš killed on the spot in the attack), “The End of Empire” (Impērijas gals, 1991), and the last short film “The Moment of Silence” (Klusuma stunda, 1992, dedicated to Zvaigzne and Slapiņš). He died tragically in 1992. Almost thirty years after Podnieks’ passing, at this discussion we aim to examine his working methods, approach to documentary, specific films, and other issues paying tribute to him and his legacy that remains.},

  abstract = {Latvian documentary filmmaker Hercs Franks (1926–2013) directed his first films in 1965, the two short documentaries were produced at the Latvian television’s production unit Telefilma-Rīga: “Salty Bread” (Sāļā maize) and “At Noon” (Pus­ dienā). Both films reflect an intricate practice and aesthetic element of the director – the use of still photography, which for him is both a research tool and a stylistic device present throughout his career. “Salty Bread” includes photographs as a stylistic element allowing the viewer to prolong observation of particular images, whereas in “At Noon” still photographs feature on the films’ credits, but more significant is photography’s use as a research tool for preparing the film. The intermedial studies have explored the interrelationship of different media and used intermediality as a tool for close reading of specific works, among other applications. The connection of cinema and photography represent the potential of intermedial approach through the technological, aesthetic, institutional practices. Specifically documentary cinema in its relation to photography shares additional issues of the meaning of documentality and representation of reality. Through close reading of Hercs Franks’ first films, I would argue that Franks transcends normative documentary function in the use of still photographs [Hallas 2023] and demonstrates the intermedial practice in combining photography and documentary filmmaking.},

  abstract = {The modern governments are conceived as to draw their legitimacy based on universal rational knowledge and the concept of controllable and calculable risks as a tool for ensuring progress and welfare of society. The multiple risks and uncertainties of modernisation that the governments were incapable to deal with caused a deficit of legitimacy and institutional ambiguity (or the institutional void as Hajer suggested calling it). Consequently, new actors and new political arenas or spaces have emerged and are expected to lead to institutional innovation. The Soviet system represents the version of the modern state which based its legitimacy on the principle of rationalism applicable towards external nature and was challenged by multiple risks and side effects of its industrial development that led to the deficit or even absence of legitimacy. The crisis of legitimacy of the Soviet state and institutional void, this paper argues, was a key premise for the former Soviet republics such as Lithuania to restore its’ statehood and indepe­ndence in search of new democratic participatory modes of governance. The theoretical perspective based on governance transformations induced by the crisis of legitimacy, uncertainties of modernisation and institutional void in the former Soviet system of governance is illuminated by two empirical cases rooted in the nuclear energy sector, namely the accident at Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant in Ukraine in 1986, and public controversy around the Ignalina Nuclear Power Plant in Lithuania.           ,              Modernios valdžios institucijos grindžia savo institucinius pamatus bei legitimaciją universaliu racionaliu žinojimu, o šis žinojimas neatsiejamas nuo kontroliuotinos ir apskaičiuotinos rizikos, – neatsiejamo visuomenės pažangos atributo.

In providing an account of embodied and everyday activities, this paper challenges the conception of a decline in public-oriented acts and affordances understood via the notion of post-socialist privatism. In doing so this paper draws on ethnographic fieldwork of recreational running, an underutilised tool for urban analysis. Despite the growing interest in recreational running amongst urban scholars, engaging with the practice has remained largely neglected within research on the post-socialist cities of Central and Eastern Europe. This paper uses a case study of two recreational running clubs from Sofia, the capital of Bulgaria, offering a discussion of everyday experience, public life and urban space. This case study combines participant observation and in-depth qualitative interviews with runners and club organisers to complicate the idea of post-socialist cities as places defined by the decline of public sensibilities and a single conception of the post-socialist condition.},

The link between politics and adolescence that is created in these novels becomes a means to normalize the representation of the socialist past in the official memory culture of Latvia and of Germany. Key to such an interpretation is a differentiated understanding of adolescence as a productive crisis: a period of transformation and disruption as well as creation of new versions of reality. Through the introduction of adolescence as a time of transgression against the ruling system, the novels put the simple distinction where East is associated with socialism and negatively equated to totalitarianism whereas the West and capitalism are positively linked to democracy. The images created in the novels run against the official memory cultures into which they are inscribed and are part of a new counter-memory, despite their geographic and temporal differences.},

  abstract = {The invasion of Ukraine is the latest in a series of upheavals that have made eastern Europe a telling point from which to consider the place of area studies in the construction of knowledge about the world. The politics of academic knowledge about ‘areas’ now feels more urgent than ever. Anti-Atlas plays with the politics of the conventional atlas, with its assumptions about knowledge and power, its hierarchies of value, and its simplifications. It presents a collection of essays written by an eclectic mix of authors from Europe, both east and west, the UK and North America. These entries analyse a necessarily incomplete selection of topics, but they all engage with the question of how an approach to area can be ‘critical’ - and each entry demonstrates different aspects of criticality. The editors develop a manifesto for such criticality, calling attention to positions that are heterodox, area-informed or vernacular, ‘undisciplined’, and collaborative. Through a variety of genres, including the scholarly article, the travel guide, autobiographical reflections and data visualisations, Anti-Atlas provides readers with a diverse series of intellectual resources, asking them to think critically about the ways in which we construct the world by dividing it into pieces.},

  abstract = {"30 years after the Soviet collapse this book aims to tackle the interplay between international and domestic dynamics in the Soviet disintegration process. Based on extensive archival research, it investigates the triangular relations between the US government, Baltic independence movements and Moscow during the Perestroika years. Occupied and illegally annexed by the USSR in 1940 Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania were the first Soviet republics to push the limits of Perestroika and demand independence from the Soviet Union. The Baltic problem, minor at first glance, started to gain more and more international visibility and by 1990 risked derailing issues that mattered in the eyes of both Soviet and American leaders -- the transformation of the Soviet state and transformation of the European order. Both Washington and Moscow wanted to diffuse the Baltic crisis, but none of them were certain how to do it. The United States had never recognized the annexation of the Baltic states and thus tried to perform a highly challenging balancing act of supporting Baltic independence without jeopardizing their relations with Kremlin. Meanwhile Gorbachev faced an increasingly pressing choice between democratization and preservation of the Soviet empire. In other words this book studies the relations between those at the top of international and domestic power hierarchies with those situated at their margins. It shows how at the time of deep historical change the disruption of existing power structures causes uncertainty that limits the agency of the powerful and opens widows of opportunity for those seen as marginal"--},

  abstract = {This article examines how Lithuanian poetry was represented for foreign readers in 15 anthologies published from 1978 to 2013 in Lithuania and abroad. The object of investigation is not a huge corpus of authors representing the official canon but the cultural, historical, political, and aesthetic aspects of Lithuanian poetry revealed in the prefaces of the anthologies. The 35 year-long process of anthologisation reveals the changing modes of national representation: the trajectory from the unknown, closed or even censored Lithuanian literature (which was oppressed by social realism and divided in two parts – exodus and Soviet Lithuanian literature) to a united picture of national literature and later to the crumbling mosaic of its parts (representing particularities grouped by gender, generations, subjects, grouping and so on). During the Soviet period the more precise translation process of Lithuanian poetry for foreign readers became possible in 70s. Till the end of the 20th century the main goal of compilers of anthologies as well as authors of prefaces was to represent national literary history beginning with the 18th century and its origins in folk culture, and highlight the historical circumstances of delayed development of national literature. From the beginning of the 21st century the care about national literature’s representation turns into a commercial project orientated towards international text circulation. According to global conditions the political resistance clearly expressed in poetic writings which was so important for the compilers of the 20th-century anthologies has transformed into the political-economic literary battlefield (the battle for publishing, translations, resistance against the dominant literary tendencies, establishment of individuality) marking a radically different political resistance.},

These films do not only form a remarkable part of the cultural heritage of these nations, but also a possible source of revenues as well. Within this context, a particularly acute question concerns the legal fate of digitized versions of these films, inflicting a multitude of copyright law issues, as the majority of these films are still protected by copyright. In contrast to the almost identical legal regulation in the Soviet period, after the collapse of the Soviet Union all the four countries investigated in this paper chose separate ways to address copyright problems which soon arose, resulting in a surprisingly heterogeneous treatment of film copyrights, which spans from considerably user-friendly solutions to factual lockups of the film stock.},

Discotheques evolved in a field in the Bourdesian sense and achieved a certain degree of autonomy during the period in question. The ideological and bureaucratic demands of the authorities became increasingly stringent by the conclusion of the decade, but the autonomy of discotheques endured.},

  abstract = {The borrowing of certain principles of text structure or other elements from drama are typical ways to dramatize a poem. Dramatization became a widespread phenomenon in Russian poetry of the late 20th and early 21st centuries. Dramatized poems can be divided into two groups: 1) texts in which we can clearly see elements of drama, such as stage directions, dramatis personae, the names of characters indicated before their speech, etc.; and 2) texts with no explicit dramatic elements but divided into conversational turns in which each utterance can potentially be attributed to a different speaker. Both types of dramatization allow us to see the creation of a new kind of subject in Russian poetry – the multiple subject. In dramatized poems we see a subject but not a persona (liricheskii geroi, according to Tynianov), because the utterances of multiple speakers cannot be united in a non-contradictory image of a single persona. At the same time, they can provide a basis for reconstructing the subject. It is important to emphasize that both strategies of dramatization imply a communicative space represented in the text that is similar in structure to space in drama. We can postulate the correspondence between the multiple subject and dramatization as a formal tool (priem).},

In media and communication studies, for example, the concept of mediatisation has sparked off such a debate, since one of the main criticisms against the approach is that researchers rather take change for granted without being able to empirically establish if and how change has occurred. In this article is suggested a model for analysing social change through an analysis of how generational identity as “we-sense” is produced in narratives about media use. The empirical basis for the discussion is picked from a recently finished project on media generations in Sweden and Estonia, building on foremost qualitative material. The article concludes with accounting for the merits of using a generational perspective for analysing social change.},

While finding Zahra’s perspective relevant, this article criticizes the choice of her central analytic concept, ‘national indifference,’ and also questions the absence of an integrated gender perspective. Finally, the article queries the general applicability of her theoretical approach. While useful in the analysis of demotic national movements, it is considerably less so when studying elite minority groups. This becomes evident when Zahra’s theoretical perspective is applied to the Baltic Germans.},

Nationalizing discourse has figured centrally in these and other ‘postmultinational’ contexts. But nationalizing projects and processes have differed substantially across cases. Where ethnonational boundaries have been strong, quasi-racial and intergenerationally persistent, as in Kazakhstan, nationalization (notwithstanding inclusive official rhetoric) has served primarily to strengthen and empower the core nation. Where ethnonational and linguistic boundaries have been blurred and permeable, as in Ukraine, nationalization has worked primarily to reshape cultural practices, loyalties and identities, thereby in effect redefining and enlarging the core nation. Where boundaries have been strong, yet show signs of being intergenerationally permeable, as in Estonia and Latvia, nationalization was initially oriented towards protecting, strengthening, and empowering the core nation as a sharply bounded collectivity, but has subsequently become more assimilationist and culturalist.},

Her films are often regarded as avant-garde, experimenting with genre conventions, challenging her audiences to reconsider their understanding of narrative and the cinematic form. Her work also pushes the boundaries between what constitutes fiction film and what constitutes documentary. This arguably occurs because of her engagement with the tropes of poetic documentary cinema, of which there is a strong tradition in Latvia due to the famous Riga School of Poetic documentary established in the 1960s. This paper examines her documentary film Čau, Rasma (“Hi, Rasma”, 2014) as a continuation of the poetic documentary tropes developed by John Grierson, and argues that verisimilitude can be found in her documentaries through an application of Grierson’s philosophical work. The paper aims to contribute to a broader discussion of poetic documentary practices in the current era, and how this documentary approach has developed from its modernist beginnings.},

Scholars working within this framework caution against the monumentalism of traumas as singular events and press for the acknowledgment of traumas experienced by minorities and liminal groups. In addition, this body of literature suggests a question of fundamental significance to memory politics: How to make sure that postcolonial attempts to memorialize the traumatic histories of colonialism do not become sources of state subjugation and oppression? Using examples from Eastern Europe, this article analyzes the complexity of memory landscapes in this region and the difficulty of acknowledging traumas of “non-Western” groups on their own terms. Drawing on works by three authors from the region (Ene Kõresaar, Svetlana Aleksievich and Jasmina Husanovic´), this essay identifies alternative ways of thinking about the nexus of trauma and difference by addressing how complexity and vulnerability can help to transcend competing victimhoods in Eastern Europe and elsewhere.},

The analysis is focused on points of memory, a theoretical concept developed by Marianne Hirsch who defined them as ‘points of intersection between past and present, memory and post-memory, personal remembrance and cultural recall.’ This approach helps us to better understand the complex processes of memory production and reconstruct the lived experiences associated with remembering war and displacement.

Sergei Eisenstein and Dziga Vertov were sharply criticized for turning things into symbols in their films. To avoid this aesthetic dispute, Tret’iakov advocated production scripts based on the dominance of material things over plot. Eisenstein, in his unfinished text ‘Play of Objects' (‘Ob igre predmetov’), offers another understanding of things in film. A film-thing (kinoveshch’), in his reading, is first an image and therefore an attraction, a conglomeration of heterogeneous circuits, awakening different areas of association and triggering social emotions. Eisenstein’s ideas may have influenced Tret’iakov’s concept of the “biography of things”. At the same time, as this analysis demonstrates, theoretical discussion about things in film had no lasting impact on the material world depicted on the Soviet screen. Films and historical documents (diaries and memoirs, customs declarations or detention inventories) tell different stories about the life of objects in Soviet Russia.},

  abstract = {The following dissertation is the first full-length study of contemporary post-avant-garde poet and critical theorist Bruce Andrews and brings to bear a decidedly post-Marxist framework on one of the most rigorously politicized and prolific bodies of North American avant-garde poetry and performance to have emerged from (and since) the Language Poetry of the 1970s and 1980s. Highlighting the singularity of Andrews’s aesthetico-political stance and poetic practice (vis-à-vis other Language Poets), the dissertation offers a theoretically-inclined and broadly Rancièrean reading of key texts and performances from the 1970s to the present to demonstrate what ties Andrews’s post-vanguardism to emancipatory politics. Engaging the decidedly post-Althusserian thought of Rancière, it argues that Andrews’s radical rethinking and appropriation of Brechtian, Adornian, Debordian, Barthesian, and Althusserian paradigms is well suited to contest a post-political social formation that presents itself as both nonideological and non-antagonistic. The dissertation amply demonstrates how Andrews seeks to critique and render perceptible the totality of late capitalist social relations and the disavowed historical contingency of today’s neoliberal consensus by soliciting a ‘dissensual’ mode of reading/listening to the social that would capacitate the subject of that experience in such a way as to facilitate a process of political subjectivization.},

The essays in Part I diagnose contemporary skepticism about personal memory, and develop an account of good remembering that is better suited to contemporary (reconstructive) theories of memory. The essays in Part II focus on the activities and practices through which we explore and negotiate the shared significance of our different recollections of the past, and the importance of sharing memory for constituting our identities. In Part III, Campbell uses her relational theory of memory to address the challenges of sharing memory and renewing selves in contexts that are fractured by moral and political difference, especially those arising from a history of injustice and oppression"},

  abstract = {In this thesis the author aims to describe the progression of a phenomenon of Czech documentary film from its first diffident steps at the end of 19th century through gradual development of its forms and approaches till the current state a decade after the turn of the millennium. For this purpose a documentary film is conceived as 'a creative interpretation of the reality' in the sense of John Grierson's understanding. Documentary production is global phenomenon and individual national schools influence each other and hence there is included a short characterization of its general development and its fundamental creative principles. Gradually the emphasis upon authorial processing of lived authentic experience prevailed. The analysis of documentary film is impossible without considering contemporary sociocultural, political and economical circumstances. Therefore, this thesis keeps drawing its attention to the description of contemporary events with the main respect to the Czech surroundings. To deepen the understanding of documentary production the author also includes the analysis of Helena Trestikova's experience of being documentary director that was acquired through the interpretation of biographic narration and interview with her. She is one of the most significant representatives of Czech documentary tradition. In the middle of author's interest stands her authentic view of turning moments of her professional life and of her perception of Czech documentary film and its progression.},

The findings suggest an integral understanding of the museum’s transition process and contribute to broader discussions on how architectural interpretation shapes national identity and reflects societal values.},

These texts reflected an anthropological experience and response to oppression and violence in human society. In this context, it is possible to see how literature and art in general are able to facilitate social change, rather than just to entertain, console and bring subjective satisfaction. Avant-gardists expressed experiences of alienated labor, interpreted as experiences of violence, through hyperbolic imagery. The author proposes to study the avant-garde in the context of the extreme experience of violence, in which the political and the poetic are sometimes entwined.},

  abstract = {In the late Soviet period, environmental issues gained an unprecedented media resonance and dramatic socio-political importance. The “Ecological Revolution” took a tragic turn in the Soviet Union, against the background of high-impact industrial and natural disasters. After the accident at the Chernobyl nuclear power station (Ukraine, 1986) and in a context of increased free-speech, Soviet citizens seized on new and old, covered up or forgotten environmental issues and demanded that a hesitant government put them on the political agenda. In a mixture of media revelations, mass demonstrations, and intense voluntary-sector activity, environmental issues of local, national and global significance ranked high among the main preoccupations of the Soviet population. In this introduction to a special issue of SPSR on the environmental history of the late Soviet Union and postSoviet Russia, we explore new avenues of understanding the upsurge of ecological perestroika from the 1960s to the 2010s.},

  abstract = {Несмотря на кажущуюся прозрачность, вопрос о соотношении мысли Луи Альтюссера и Алена Бадью, учителя и ученика, может получить новую трактовку, если рассмотреть позднюю философию Альтюссера, носящую имя «алеаторный материализм», как попытку обоснования политической практики посредством концептов случайности, встречи и пустоты, задающих онтологическую проблематику. При этом ключевую функцию здесь выполняет материалистическая философия, определить которую Альтюссер стремился в разные периоды своей работы. Одно из таких определений  можно обнаружить в его интерпретации философской практики Макиавелли, носящей сингулярный характер. Более того, в посвященном Макиавелли тексте обнаруживается попытка сконструировать концепт политического субъекта, который в поздних сочинениях исчезает. Отсюда можно предположить, что альтюссеровская «теория встречи» в ее политических экспликациях расщепляется на две различные философские стратегии, объединенные приматом алеаторности: в первой конструируется специфическая «пустота» исторической конъюнктуры, которую должен занять грядущий субъект политической практики; во второй доминирующая роль отводится онтологическому концепту пустоты и действию «клинамена». Сопоставление внутренне расщепленной теории Альтюссера с концепцией события Бадью позволяет сделать вывод о том, что в философии последнего так или иначе совмещаются две обозначенные стратегии.},

  abstract = {The success of mass mobilization in Lithuania against Soviet rule in the late 1980s can be attributed in part to the spread of the ethnocultural movement in the post-Stalin era. Characterized in this paper as the “rustic turn,” it began in the late 1950s with the Soviet-wide rehabilitation of kraevedenie (local area studies), part of Khrushchev’s effort to rejuvenate grassroots political participation across the USSR. In Soviet Lithuania, the rehabilitation of kraštotyra had the unintended consequence of restoring nation-building practices from the interwar period and reintegrating individuals repressed under Stalin into public life. Rather than shaping Soviet subjects, the ethnocultural movement developed rituals of transformation that imbued the rustic ethnic past, not the Soviet future, with the aura of sacrality. Ostensibly apolitical, the movement nevertheless cultivated strong associative ties among citizens from various walks of life. With the outbreak of free discussion under glasnost, mass gatherings built upon the rituals of the ethnocultural movement to generate a community of affect grounded in nostalgia for a lost, mythical past and the trauma of displacement under the Soviet regime.},

  abstract = {[only abstract in English; full article and abstract in Lithuanian]  This article analyzes post-war Sovietization through the prism of the first feature film made in Soviet Lithuania – Marytė – directed by Vera Strojeva and released in 1947, revealing the intention, process and outcome of propaganda in the newly occupied society under Stalinism. As the culture of cinema was part of a broader ideological endeavor, the analysis of this film helps to understand developments across the new Soviet western borderlands. This article reconstructs the context of the narrative of the film, its creation, dissemination and evaluation. The central character of the film is a Soviet Lithuanian war hero – a young female partisan captured and shot in the area of her native Zarasai. The authors analyze the construction of this protagonist in the film following the classical Soviet archetype of the young female “war saint”, similar to the Russian Zoya Kosmodemjanskaja. The choice of a female protagonist for the promotion of the “new Soviet subject” in the recently occupied territory is significant and may be interpreted as a deliberate attempt for encouraging a more sympathetic identification with the Soviet interpretation of history – especially in a country where an anti-Soviet partisan struggle was still taking place. The authors also demonstrate how well-established national and cultural metaphors and narratives were used in constructing a new ideology, considering the focus of this movie on the local level, the cinematic difficulties encountered and the critical reviews. The study employs interdisciplinary methodological tools that demonstrate the benefits of the cultural analysis of text and context.           ,              [straipsnis ir sanrauka lietuvių kalba; santrauka anglų kalba]  Straipsnyje siekiama rekonstruoti pokario sovietizacijos procesus, remiantis pirmojo sovietų Lietuvai skirto vaidybinio filmo „Marytė“ (rež. Vera Strojeva, 1947) analize. Tyrimu atskleidžiamos naujai okupuotos visuomenės indoktrinavimo formos ir jų poveikis stalinizmo metais. Analizuojamas kino kūrinys buvo sudėtinė platesnės ideologinės programos dalis, todėl filmo analizė padeda geriau suvokti šios programos užmojus, lokalizacijos strategijas, visuomenės mobilizavimo metodus ir skverbimosi galimybes ne tik lietuviškajame kontekste, bet apskritai vadinamuosiuose „sovietiniuose Vakaruose“ ar SSRS vakariniame „paribio“ regione. Straipsnyje rekonstruojami filmo naratyvo, jo kūrimo, sklaidos ir vertinimų kontekstai. Filmo teksto analizės lygmenyje bandoma atsakyti į klausimą, kokios įsišaknijusios kultūrinės metaforos ir pasakojimai buvo naudojami konstruojant naujas ideologemas. Rekonstruojant filmo kūrimo, sklaidos ir vertinimų kontekstus, dėmesys kreiptas į SSRS kino gamybos procesus, į tai, kiek dėmesio filmui teikta lokaliame lygmenyje, kokių kino sklaidos sunkumų ir vertinimų šis filmas patyrė.},

The film's impact at the time was li ited because the relatively undeveloped film distribution network and the disrupt caused by the anti-Soviet armed resistance. For those who did view the film, the narr of Maryté evoked a 'reality' quite different from the recent experience of Soviet mas portations, the anti-Soviet insurgency, and the predominant mood of fear and insecur Nonetheless, its narrative was attuned to local concerns and vernacular motifs, seekin exploit national state-building themes propagated during the interwar period, drawi link between Sovietization, national, and individual emancipation, with gender playin important role. The film appealed to the economic, national and social self-interest of viewers through its depiction of the redistribution of land, the return of Vilnius as capital of Lithuania, and the opportunities for young men and women offered by the regime. This article examines Maryté as an illustration of the methods, means and o tives of Soviet propaganda and cultural policy in the Western borderlands, and the ma in which a Soviet technological and ideological template was adapted to suit local circ stances and views on history, culture and identity. In this regard, Maryté graphically set trend of postwar Soviet attempts of tapping into nationalist sentiment in order to struct a Soviet-Lithuanian identity.},

C’est un engloutissement sans traces. Les deux vidéos étudiées de J. Hanono et de F. Menini redoublent le paradoxe parce que l’appareil vidéo, à la différence du cinéma, permet difficilement que le spectateur enchaîne sur l’oeuvre qui enkyste le maintenant d’une phrase-affect (Lyotard). Cette phrase-affect est ce qui subsiste d’un tel vécu traumatique, soit que la vidéaste ait vécu de l’intérieur sa propre disparition, soit qu’elle ait été témoin d’une destruction de masse. L’enjeu de ces vidéos est alors de rejoindre le maintenant passé du trauma, en luttant contre la répétition de la pulsion de mort (Freud) par la mise en place d’une représentation vidéographique.           ,              Political disappearance — which is not yet a concept for the so-called political sciences — is a paradoxical event: by definition, there will be no witnesses and the perpetrators will not speak up. It is an engulfment that leaves no traces. The two videos studied here, J. Hanono and F. Menini's, reinforce this paradox because the video device, in contrast to that of cinema, makes it difficult for the spectator to connect with a work that encysts the here and now of a phrase-affect (Lyotard). This phrase-affect is what subsists from a certain traumatic experience, whether the video artist has experienced his/her own disappearance from the inside, or (s)he has witnessed mass destruction. What is at stake in these videos is the attempt to reunite the past here and now of the trauma, while fighting against the repetition of the death drive (Freud) by means of the set-up of a videographic representation.},

Nevertheless, at the same time there were societies and communities (USSR, Nazi Germany, kibbutzis and communitar’ communities), which adopted a totally different idea of the subject: the child in these communities was interpreted as a partner, children actively partici- pated in the grown-up life — in building of new world. The pedagogical strat- egy was being created which was, contrary to the leading European model, aimed at uniting the «grownup» world and the «children’s» worlds, which was reflected in developingcommon symbols and rituals. All these societies and communities had one common feature — they were created to realize an attempt at utopian projects. This way of life implied peculiar work with cul- tural memory—following the lead of the ideal. To practice the utopian way of life meant to participate in history, to continuously correlate oneself with it. How did this attitude to the past transform the pedagogical strategy? How was it reflected in everyday life of children and adolescents, what practices, rituals and games were produced by it? How were the relations built between generations? This is the set of questions discussed in this article.},

  abstract = {The article analyses Jacques Rancière’s theory of paradoxical interconnection between politics and aesthetics in contemporary culture. Author argues that Rancière’s theory belongs to the trend in modern philosophy, which develops the concept of autonomy of political referring back to Karl Schmitt, while Rancière’s theory of art is based on the concept of autonomy of the aesthetical, and represents politics and aesthetics as two modes of sensuality, or, in terms of Rancière, ‘the distribution of the sensual’. In this context, Rancière understands the connection between aesthetics and politics not in the sense of the ‘aesthetisation of politics’ inherent to the ‘age of the masses’, compromised by great totalitarian projects, but as a special sensual regime, which, according to Rancière, coincides with the regime of democracy as an absolute anomaly of power. Rancière’s thesis that the political, starting from antiquity, is being displaced and depoliticized by the so called postpolitics as promise of a tolerant, rational post-ideological consensus and post-democracy, or ‘democracy without demos’, is considered in the context of Rancière’s analysis of contemporary art. As alternative to modern forms of depoliticisation and rational consensus, Rancière proposes the formation of new type of rationality - rationality of disagreement or dissensus, as type of paradoxical rationality that correlates with the paradoxicality of really political action as unpredictable/ impossible. The purpose of modern art, as well as modern politics, is, according to Rancière, to create unpredictable and undecidable aesthetic gap that provides for the effect of new sensibility and consonance in affect or ‘community of equals’ that implements the principle of equality here and now.},

Contextualized by other sources from the archive of this Letter Department and others, these sources begin to illuminate how the Central Committee’s Letter Department functioned and how it evolved during Perestroika. These letters also allow us to begin to incorporate more ordinary citizens’ conceptions of glasnost into the history of this concept. These sources show at least four definitions of glasnost that circulated in the first years of reform. None of these definitions coincided with the liberal concept of “freedom of speech”. The conversation about glasnost in these letters challenges the common liberal teleology of studies of Perestroika, highlighting the distinctly Soviet nature of those who wrote letters and the concepts they wrote about.},

I analyse Latvian attempts to establish historical presence in European modernity through appropriation of 17th-century colonial pursuits of the Duchy of Courland into Latvian national history, as well as interpretations of this historical appropriation by Western scholars and travellers. I argue that Latvian identification with Europe’s colonial past not only renders visible the continued salience of coloniality in European politics but also illuminates the mechanisms through which Europe attempts to renew its moral superiority in the global arena by relegating colonialism to a past that Europe claims to have overcome and that Latvians are required to overcome to become fully European. I argue that in order to understand how coloniality continues to inform political life in contemporary Europe it is necessary to move beyond analysis of national histories and deploy a relational approach which traces how contemporary political subjects are constituted in racialized and racializing fields of power relations. It is also necessary to analyse postsocialist Eastern Europe not only in relation to the socialist past but also the global present.},

  abstract = {This paper considers how nation branding is thinkable as a response to a particular problematisation of nation and self in the new Europe. It is written from within the disciplinary terrain of anthropology and thus adheres to certain scholarly practices of the discipline. These pertain to research methods, analytical frames and textual representations. Research for this paper involved extended semi-structured interviews with the staff of government agencies, representatives of the private sector, academics and nation branding experts/practitioners; review of theoretical and policy material and of media coverage; and media coverage of image building or nation branding in Latvia. The aim of this paper is to trace the discourses and practices of those who are (or were at the time of the research) actively involved in nation branding or were identified as supportive or critical of nation branding efforts. The paper focuses on the ways of thinking and acting that nation branding presupposes and constitutes rather than representative views on nation branding. The analytical frame and style of writing correspond to anthropology’s attempts to recognise the positionality of the author which is never entirely neutral, but rather always already situated in the world. The boundaries between a knowing subject and the object of their knowledge are not strictly enforced, but rather constitute a site of reflection on how both subjects and objects are (re)made through production of knowledge.},

The focus is on John Batman, often considered to be the founder of Melbourne, and a subject that has been commemorated in numerous forms. We explore the ways in which reified understandings of Batman were consolidated by these memorials. We argue that they provided a basis for the rampant settler colonialism that was initiated by his arrival in what became Melbourne. While the power of the Batman myth has endured for many years, we show how more recently it has been challenged by a range of artinspired memorials that provide oppositional and alternative meanings and forms. We especially focus on the potency of counter-memorials, forms that directly address these older modes of commemoration, and anti-memorials, inventive installations that seek to dissolve singular meanings and continue the work of decentring outmoded commemorative forms and narratives.},

Being neither here (Great Britain as a place of exile) nor there (Latvian exile society as a substitute of a nation) characterizes the life of one of the best Latvian existentialist prose writers – Guntis Zariņš (1926–1965). In Zariņš’ life and work he negotiated several liminal areas – from his war and professional experience, literary presentation to his standing in the Latvian exile community. Whether it is voluntary/involuntary or internal/external, the process of exile is one where an individual is removed from a place of origin (a homeland) therefore one of the crucial questions to solve is a relationship between the experience of cultural displacement and the construction of cultural identity. The time when Guntis Zariņš became prominent in Latvian exile literature, coincided with the time when the change of generations had started. Guntis Zariņš was one of the first exile writers who visited Soviet Latvia in order to personally meet colleagues-writers from the other side of Iron Curtain and cooperate with them in the field of literature but he was trapped between two powers – Britain and Soviet secret services that eventually led to his mental instability and suicide. Zariņš’ case is an example of an individual and undesired exile where prolonged liminal phase and inability to integrate neither into the host society nor to establish apolitical and cultural contacts with homeland resulted in an excellent existentialist prose on the one hand and ruined individuality on the other.},

Performing classical works theatre relates them to the changing social context and thus actualises their meaning. Theatrical representations of national characters and mythical stories participate in reinforcing or redefining national identity. In independent Estonia of the 1990s–2000s the need for reconsidering national values and myths that served to consolidate society in the Soviet period, has become evident. The article focuses on theatrical productions in the turn of the century, which are based on active rewriting of well-known Estonian classics (August Kitzberg, Oskar Luts, and the national epic Kalevipoeg). The article tries to answer two questions: how ingredients of national identity (for instance, the relation to the Other) are displayed and (de)constructed by adapting or rewriting of above-mentioned classics; how textual strategies aimed at semantic transformations are motivated and shaped by the principle of self-reflexive theatrical play.},

In Estonian drama criticism, the dogmatic understanding of socialist realism was quite vital in this period. The disputes focused on three concepts deemed obligatory for drama: contemporaneity, strong conflict, and a positive hero. Drama was routed back towards the old model of the 19th century well-made play. At the same time, the audiences in the theatre favoured national classics, staged in the traditional realistic style. This tradition presumably shaped also the contemporary drama, as far as it was influenced by the system of expectancy of the audiences. So, while criticism was forcing a simplified model of socialist realism upon the stage, the theatre strategies of the time worked in service of preserving the 1930s-style realistic tradition.},

  abstract = {This article explores discourses and practices that have shaped border regimes in different times at Russia’s western frontier, focusing on the interplay between state power, border management, and individual lives. Using a “comparative temporalities” approach, it analyses border control processes in the early Soviet period, during the Cold War, and during the Russian war on Ukraine. It assumes that current Russian border policy has visible parallels with systems dating back to 1920s Soviet border policy and to the Cold War (the adoption of police-style management of transborder mobility). It posits that the comparative temporalities approach reveals an alternation between ‘fluid’, ‘semi-transparent’ Russian borders and more impenetrable barriers. Stricter exit border controls are usually reintroduced after periods of border liberalization and laxity related to regime change, e.g., after the Russian Revolution and Civil War, and after the demise of the USSR in 1991. Initially, increasingly authoritarian and repressive control of citizens’ mobility was accompanied by confusion and an increasingly arbitrary application of new, ‘politicized’ markers as local border authorities strove to implement new restrictions under increased state pressure. Then, borders were once again hardened and placed under stricter control. This intensified repression and helped create zones of instability at the borders.},

A notable characteristic of recent poetry is that the subject of the text becomes “split” into the “Writing Self” that generates the direct speech structure of the text and the “Other Self” that acts as a reflective instance in relation to the former. Applying Jacques Lacan’s “split subject” concept to the analysis of contemporary poetic texts, we identify a range of creative and communicative strategies through which the subject finds its reflexive origin in the text. These strategies are as follows: a metalinguistic, intertextual, or removal and dismissal strategy; a role-playing strategy; and a bodily strategy. These strategies change and alternate in a given author’s texts as well as interact and overlap with each other, creating a more complex system of dependencies within the “split” subject.},

  abstract = {In his “Cinema as Philosophical Experimentation”, Alain Badiou argues that cinema, like philosophy, stages the emergence of novel syntheses from an encounter between irreconcilable terms. For example, as a mass art, cinema is itself the product of the collision of two incompatible terms: the aristocracy (historically the patrons of ‘high’ art) and democracy. Cinema thus constitutes a philosophical situation, for as Badiou writes, “A philosophical situation is an encounter between terms that are foreign to each other”. But what are the implications of cinema for moral philosophy, or ethics? Using the example of John Ford’s The Searchers (1956), I explore Badiou’s claim that because cinema thinks in images, it does not merely represent ethical conflicts; it thinks these conflicts out, enacting them in images much the same way that ethics thinks the relationship between Good and Evil through concepts. Exploring the question of cinema’s relationship to the emergence of truths and the democratization of knowledge, this essay asks: does cinema proffer the mere simulacrum of a Badiouian event? Or, might it reveal important truths about the relationship between reality and images? I conclude by suggesting that cinema is perhaps the most ethical of artforms in Badiou’s sense of the term, as it articulates the ethical imperative: ‘keep going’! Despite what Badiou perceives to be its many weaknesses, cinema at times miraculously overcomes its impurity, yielding unique ideas and novel truths.},

The second is that the centrality of documents leads to a view of normativity according to which human beings are primarily passive receptors of rules manifested through documents. We are not intentional producers of values. The latter, as I shall suggest in my conclusion, should be viewed as being ‘socially dependent’ rather than ‘socially constructed’.},

  abstract = {In societies with a non-elementary degree of complexity, we find institutions, social roles, promises, marriages, corporations, enterprises, and the large variety of what we can label “social objects”. On the one hand, we commonly speak and think of such entities as if they existed on a par with entities such as tables and persons. On the other hand, there is a clear link between what people think and how people behave and the social domain. We argue that the widespread “reductionist” approach in social ontology fails to account for both those aspects of social reality, and put forward a new approach. The main idea is that a particular kind of social objects, namely documents – and more generally records of social acts – are the ground of social reality. The fundamental difference from the reductionist approach is that the content of collective intentions will turn out to be not so important in accounting for the ontological variety of complex social realities such as ours.},

  abstract = {Social ontology has experienced significative growth in the last decades. In particular, a promising research agenda concerns social objects. The reference to social objects implies sharing a realistic conception of the world which allows a definitive departure from the post-modern vision of the social world as a fluid and elusive organism. A taxonomy that distinguishes between social, physical and ideal objects can, on the contrary, reinvigorate human sciences getting over the well-known methodological controversies of the last years. The theory of Documentality provides heuristic power and a solid basis for organisational resources: all potentially reliable sources for the web society. Documentality theory aims to represent a valid alternative to Searle ontology, and at the same time to offer both theoretical and practical developments.},

  abstract = {The paper invites a rethink of the political conception of Jacques Rancière, a philosopher who devoted considerable reflexion to the problem of the sharing of the sensible. Rancière proposes considering the aesthetic regime without the concept of representation. According to the author, this leads him to a paradox: on the one hand, he states that the aesthetic regime takes images for art; on the other hand, he doesn’t pay attention to the fact that it shouldn’t be possible to conceive of any regime of sharing without the concept of representation. Therefore, the author proposes a deconstructive reading of Rancière’s critique of representation,demonstrating that if the contemporary image is conceived and produced in order to be shared, it can’t be freed from representation. Finally, the author puts forth the notion of meta-representation as a solution avoiding Rancière’s antinomies.},

Non-binary gender identities are contextualized by the co-relation between sex/gender, gender self-representation (gender expression), and sexual and romantic attraction, which implicate various combinations of masculinity and femininity as they define the identity of the lyrical subject. The paper discusses several nonbinary identities such as the polygender homosexual lyrical subject (Gila Loran, Iashka Kazanova), androgynous bisexual subject (Nailia Iamakova), and the agender asexual subject (Marianna Geide).},

  abstract = {Chzhungo means “China” in Chinese, and Tret’iakov’s book by this unusual title was the outcome of his living and teaching in Peking during 1924 and 1925. It was first published in 1927. A second revised and amplified edition came out in 1930, but after the author’s execution in 1937 his books disappeared from Soviet libraries. Very few copies of either edition of Chzhungo reached libraries outside Russia. As the editors of the partial re-editions of works by Tret’iakov after his posthumous “rehabilitation” decided not to bring Chzhungo back into circulation, it remains unavailable in print. This article offers an introduction to the book. Referring to the second edition, the author analyses the self-positioning of Tret’iakov as an involved observer of Chinese life and political awakening; the image of China that emerges from Chzhungo; and the status of Chzhungo within the larger context of Tret’iakov’s work.},

  abstract = {This article examines the use of central perspective in photography during the time of industrialisation and collectivisation, and how perspective symbolically affects the intrinsic subject function and various representational effects. The author argues that perspective and its symbolic potential 1. impacted substantially on the Soviet-era mediascape and 2. gave effect to the concept of the liberated worker in control of the means of production. Taking a typical motif from this time, the “ploughed field”, the author examines how the perspective dispositif structurally constitutes the subject. Central perspective, criticized by the artistic avant-garde during the 1920s, was put to new use in the propaganda journal SSSR na Stroike (USSR in Construction). The subject function of central perspective was reflexively challenged and defamiliarized, indicating the displacement and dissolution of the subject’s agency into the immanence of the material-economic production process. In the course of the 1930s, central perspective hardened unevenly into classical representational structures – a process that has left traces in present-day media and politico-economic developments.},

The project tried to shed light on the shared impact that long-silenced traumas and counter-memories have on the Baltic region, especially from a transnational perspective. A special focus lies on the oscillations between individual memory and public history as the exhibition participants engage in the creation of so-called ‘artistic historiographies’ based on unexplored and unknown memories by minorities and women. The displayed artworks are experimentally trying to provoke a process of ‘unlearning inherited histories’ by developing multifocal viewpoints and interpretations, an ongoing process the text accompanies. Navigating through the exhibitions’ conceptual threads, artistic manifestations, and ways of storytelling, the review introduces a generation of artists that is bonded to difficult and therefore challenging historical events from the 20th century, from the Holodomor in Soviet Ukraine to the Dąbroszczacy soldiers and autofictional lesbian literature.},

  abstract = {Marx is reputed to have said that “there is nothing so practical as a good theory.” Seventy-odd years of Soviet theorizing have left little useful practical theory behind, as demonstrated by the transformations currently taking place in Russia's borderlands. As the Soviet Union crumbles, the successor states face a unique and troubling situation. For over 70 years, their administrative structures have been centralized; their economies, transportation and communications systems, and the physical infrastructure all controlled from Moscow under a coherent ideological regime. The successor states find themselves adrift ideologically and administratively, but the centralized physical infrastructure remains.             How are these states to design new administrative structures? How are they to cope with the utter failure of their theoretical principles? How may they cooperate in the use of the physical systems while establishing their political independence? Soviet administrative theory—the “scientific theory of socialism” as it was called—has been unable to provide even the most basic guidance for the process, and western administrative theory is not equipped to address the special problems of the new states. The insights of the neo-institutionalists can provide guidelines for these urgent problems.},

Противопоставляются «познавательный» и «опытно- событийный» подходы к поэзии, в основе которых лежат два раз- ных отношения к истине: через язык в случае знания и через опыт, если мы понимаем поэзию как собы- тие. Для того чтобы понять отноше- ние поэзии к знанию, также ставится вопрос об отношении опыта и языка. Основной здесь оказывается про- блема возможности до-предикатив- ного опыта. Именно ответ на вопрос о возможности такого опыта задает то, как мы определяем отношение поэзии к опыту и знанию.},

The lack of indicators of ironic distance makes it easy for the reader to project this lower status from the subject onto the author, which appears to compromise the artist on an evaluative scale and his/her entitlement to produce “cultural texts”. This paper offers a survey of the most common methods by which the degradation of the subject is performed: violation of poetic norms; simulation of language and thought pathology; as well as metapoetic commentary. Finally, the paper discusses the question of function, and argues that through such a paradoxical strategy, the poet provokes the reader into moving beyond the textual frames, with the result that the author himself or herself is drawn into the space of the artistic work.},

  abstract = {In the Soviet Union, song competitions had an important role in presenting new artists and songs. The Mikrofona aptauja contest of Latvian radio (1968–1994) was the main forum for new Latvian pop music. It had a reputation for expressing nationalist feelings within the limits of Soviet censorship. In 1988, with the rise of new political movements in the Soviet Union, the competition became a venue for the Latvian independence movement. The winning song of 1988 was a demand for ‘freedom to the fatherland’. The competition also played a part in the rehabilitation of pre-war popular music which had been forbidden in Soviet Latvia. The paper discusses the role of journalists, politicians and songwriters in this process. After the privatisation of the economy, the song competition was taken over by private entrepreneurs, as public interest in political songs waned.},

  abstract = {This article constructs a typology of the poetic subject in the poetry of Gennadii Aigi, with a focus on address in lyric communication. It first distinguishes the poetic ego (the speaking entity) from the poetic subject and correlates the latter with the concept of the reader/addressee. While the poetic ego is verbally and poetically expressed in the text, the poetic subject is merely implied and must be reconstructed by the reader as the entity responsible for the poetically and verbally expressed text. This article suggests a fivefold typology of poetic subjects in Aigi’s poetry: 1) a referential subject that is dominated by the relation of itself to the world; 2) an “addressive” subject that is governed by its relation to the addressee; 3) a subject determined by its relation to the verbal and poetic tropes used and/or thematized in the poem; 4) a highly hybrid subject that is characterized by crossreferencing literary and cultural media; and 5) a subject that performs a religious syncretism by which a new kind of psalmody is achieved. This typology enables us to bring the variety of Aigi’s texts into a systematic relation with the concept of the poetic subject.},

  abstract = {Throughout the 1960s, Soviet cinema developed new approaches to newsreels and documentaries. The Soviet documentary was moving away from the propagandistic straightforwardness of the Stalin era. Referring to the theorist Viktor Shklovskii and the movie director Dziga Vertov, the discussion of the chronicle turned to its artistic qualities. Instead of being used as an ideological tool, the chronicle now was transformed into an element of cinematic language. It was particularly the so-called poetic cinema of Mikhail Kalik (1927–2007) that combined feature film scenes with documentary material. Poetic devices created an effect of detachment and gave new meaning to the chronicle. As a result, poetic cinema’s chronicle ceased to be just a documentary means of spreading news and instead became a way of rethinking the historical past, thereby refiguring the relationship between the collective and the individual.},

  abstract = {Il existe de nombreux concepts géographiques et historiques pour définir l’Europe du Nord, l’Europe de l’Est ainsi que la région de la mer Baltique. Les études sur les cartes mentales ont déjà démontré que ces notions ne sont pas uniquement fondées sur la géographie physique ou sur des réalités historiques clairement délimitées. Au contraire, les concepts se chevauchent souvent, sont aussi parfois partiellement contradictoires~; ils diffèrent selon les langues et changent avec le temps. Ces divisions spatiales de l’Europe (comme d’au-delà) proviennent en premier lieu des imaginaires politiques, sociaux et culturels. Elles s’enchevêtrent lorsqu’on les observe à l’échelle transnationale, comme l’immense majorité des phénomènes socio-culturels, et dépendent de paramètres politiques et socio-culturels, mais aussi des époques et des points de vue des divers acteurs. Cet article s’intéresse aux concepts épistémologiques et politiques liés aux espaces baltiques et nordiques ainsi qu’à leur évolution, surtout depuis le XIXe~siècle. Il se penche tout d’abord sur les notions mouvantes de «~Nord~» et d’«~Est~» de l’Europe, puis de région «~baltique~». Dans les sections suivantes, la fluidité de l’espace «~baltique~» est présentée et discutée au prisme du concept d’espace «~nordique~». De plus, d’autres concepts culturels, politiques ou académiques, qui font référence à une région baltique étendue, comme par exemple la «~Baltoscandie~» ou l’Europe du Nord-Est, sont examinés. L’article met en évidence le fait que, d’une part, les différents concepts d’espace «~baltique~» ne font pas uniquement référence aux «~trois États baltes~» et que, d’autre part, les notions de «~baltique~» et de «~nordique~» se recoupent et se mélangent au XXe et au XXIe~siècles. Enfin, dans les discussions actuelles, l’espace «~baltique~», à la différence du «~Norden~», n’est pas forcément fondé sur une homogénéité culturelle, sociale ou politique, mais suppose plutôt un intérêt particulier pour la question de l’unité compte tenu de la diversité des sociétés qui peuplent la région de la mer Baltique.           ,              There are various spatial and historical concepts of Northern and Eastern Europe, and~– not least~– of the Baltic Sea Region. Debates on mental maps have already shown that such notions are neither based solely on physical geography nor on clearly delimitated historical units. Instead, the concepts are often overlapping, and partly also contrary to each other, they are differing according to languages, and in addition changing over time. Thus, such debates about the spatial division of Europe (and beyond) emerge first of all from political, social, and cultural imaginaries. Furthermore, they are as almost every social and cultural phenomenon transnationally entangled and depend on political, social, and cultural settings as well as on epochs and perspectives. This text focuses on epistemological and political concepts connected to Baltic and Nordic spaces and their trajectories, in particular since the 19th~century. It starts with the changing notions of, first, the European “North” and “East”, and, second, the “Baltic” region. In the following sections, the fluidity of “Baltic” space is presented and discussed in its relations to concepts of “Nordic” space. Furthermore, other scholarly and political or cultural notions that refer to the wider Baltic Sea region or to parts of it, as for instance Baltoscandia or North-Eastern Europe, are addressed. Main theses developed in this text are, first, that concepts of “Baltic” space do not exclusively refer to the “three Baltic States” and, second, that notions referring to “Baltic” or “Nordic” are closely intertwined in the 20th and 21st~centuries. Third, in recent debates “Baltic” space~– in distinction to “Norden”~– is based less on the region’s cultural, social, or political homogeneity, but encompasses a focus on the issue of unity in diversity within the societies of the Baltic Sea region.},

  abstract = {In this article, I describe common narratives of history in postcommunist Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia and explore the intersection between multiculturalism and memory politics. I argue that dealing with history is a challenge in these countries and can be seen as part of a broader issue of memory politics in societies that have experienced trauma during the Nazi and Soviet eras. The hypothesis that I developed, based on my empirical analysis, is that it makes visible how a difficult process of negotiating competing memories can, under certain circumstances, lead to dialogical remembrance. The article also pays attention to unexpected events, such as the Russian invasion of Ukraine, which gives a new dynamic to this process. The original contribution of this article is an analysis of historical narratives in three national museums, with a special focus on how these museums deal with the injustices and traumas experienced by different ethnic groups in the Baltic states.

  abstract = {In this article, I describe common narratives of history in postcommunist Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia and explore the intersection between multiculturalism and memory politics. I argue that dealing with history is a challenge in these countries and can be seen as part of a broader issue of memory politics in societies that have experienced trauma during the Nazi and Soviet eras. The hypothesis that I developed, based on my empirical analysis, is that it makes visible how a difficult process of negotiating competing memories can, under certain circumstances, lead to dialogical remembrance. The article also pays attention to unexpected events, such as the Russian invasion of Ukraine, which gives a new dynamic to this process. The original contribution of this article is an analysis of historical narratives in three national museums, with a special focus on how these museums deal with the injustices and traumas experienced by different ethnic groups in the Baltic states. The final section of the article is devoted to the reaction of people in these countries to the Russian invasion of Ukraine on 24 February 2022, and how this relates to the politics of history created in Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia after 1991.},

  abstract = {Democracy and civic society in Latvia are strongly affected by a multifaceted gap between the ethnic majority and minorities within contemporary Latvian society. The political elite are crucial actors in the politics of integration in Latvia. Postcolonial theories can help evaluate and explain the insufficiency of current integration policies in Latvia in respect to the participation of ethnic minorities in Latvia. Current integration challenges will be examined here based on two related issues of Latvian integration policies: (1) the process of naturalization and (2) the conflicting concepts of the twentieth-century Latvian history, especially the occupation in 1940. Both issues should be “revisited” using postcolonial explanatory potential in order to identify the causes of the long-lasting failure of integration policies in Latvia.},

His approach, it is shown, had its roots in his explication of notion of ideal which led him to assign priority to work with respect to language at a general level as well as at the level ontogenesis of human infants. Two additional factors shaped his approach to the phenomenon of language. The first was his negative approach to disciplines investigating the structure of language: mathematical logic, logical semantics, and philosophy of language. The second was his treatment of Hegel’s philosophy from which he took over only those features that were appropriated and further developed by Marx. The article gives an analysis of Ilyenkov’s view on the educational process of deafblind children and it shows that this view contradicted the views on that process presented in the works of Meshcheryakov and Sirotkin. Finally, the article provides a characterization of work, language and of their relation.},

It reviews the various streams of this theoretical development and employs Edward Said’s notion of “traveling theory” to demonstrate that theoretical claims made by proponents and opponents of this particular comparative perspective are historically, socially, and geographically situated, although not fixed. Disciplinary, national, and institutional affiliations, instead of theoretical justifications, are identified as important factors in the propensity to accept or resist the introduction of post-colonial perspective on Central and Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union. The essay concludes by acknowledging the potential usefulness as well as the limits of post-colonialism in the conceptualization of the post- socialist space.},

Tret’iakov’s reports on China in Chzhungo (1927, second edition 1930) analyses his future-oriented ethnography and his perspective of reversal that aims at the theatralisation of reality. He tried to integrate the effect of a dramatised trial into his judgmental, journalistic prose. Inspired by Chinese theatre as a source for avant-garde aesthetics, Tret’iakov presents China as a stage and likely borrows the idea of standardising new role models from Chinese theatre, which constitutes not only one of the shifts from old to new that he documents, but also an instrument and symbol of Tret’iakov’s participant observation project. Oscillating between journalist and poet, Tret’iakov develops intergeneric journalism into a new form of literature.},

  abstract = {Among readers of Jacques Rancière there is a discussion about the possibility of aesthetics substituting for real political action. This is because while the French author elaborates on the conception of the emancipated spectator, he states that the political task of art cannot be the removal of the spectator from her “passive” condition into the dimension of political action, but only the suspension of the relationship between “active” and “passive”. However, in Aisthesis, published in 2011, Rancière warns the reader that it is not a case of abandoning the aesthetic utopia, even if any teleological view is withdrawn. In this article, I intend to discuss these paradoxes by confronting the considerations of Le Spectateur émancipé and La Haine de la démocratie, trying to show that if politics itself presupposes action, the politics of aesthetics must be understood as a non-identification process that takes subjects out of the places that were “addressed” to them beforehand. In La Haine de la démocratie one of the symptoms of the crisis of representative democracy is presented by the fact that it produces oligarchies and, on the other hand, new social dynamics appear as the conquest of a new citizenship that confronts these political oligarchies. Noting that demonstrations today, whether in Turkey, Spain, or New York, are similar to artistic happenings, Rancière can say that where there is aesthetics there is democracy. Understanding this last statement is the aim of the present article.},

  abstract = {This PhD project examines the role of commemorative and ritual practices in the transmission of Soviet myths in Latvia while taking into account the broader post-Soviet context. The study addresses the following research questions: How do different perceptions of the Soviet past coexist within contemporary Latvian society? What are the main forms and characteristics of the Soviet myth in today’s Latvia, and how do they differ from the Soviet myth in Russia and other post-Soviet countries? A mixed-methods design was implemented, comprising a survey of 404 respondents to identify Latvian residents’ opinions about the Soviet past, their patriotic and nostalgic feelings, and their participation in commemorative and ritual practices related to Soviet repressions, occupation, and World War II events. The survey also investigated how individuals from different ethnolinguistic groups (Russian-speaking and Latvian-speaking respondents) interpret the meaning of Soviet myths and participate in contemporary commemorative practices related to the Soviet legacy. Additionally, the study included the quantitative analysis of 30 in-depth interviews with respondents to provide descriptive narratives of commemorative rituals and pay specific attention to interviewees’ experiences and beliefs, emotions, and personal memories of the Soviet past. Furthermore, the study compared secondary data analysis (survey data, media, and academic reports) with primary interviews with stakeholders (notably, the organisers of Victory Day celebrations and politicians) to analyse how the Soviet legacy and related commemorative practices are used for current political needs.},

  abstract = {I argue that postcolonial discourses are essential to unearthing and revising the complicated dynamic of codependence between Western and Eastern European nationalisms, which is haunted by internalized and rarely acknowledged traces of imperialism on both sides. However, the spatial expansion of postcolonial discourse to Europe’s own backyard needs to be matched by an expansion of research methods and objects. Postcolonial studies’ traditional commitment to theory and to textual analysis of literature and art cinema is beneficially complemented by engaging with popular media, such as television. It is also crucial to critically analyze the contexts of production and dissemination in which certain aesthetic and theoretical models are formed, lest we risk simply reaffirming the patterns in which Eastern European cultural nationalisms have reproduced themselves, which have also functioned to contain and disavow racism and imperialism. I propose to integrate within the postcolonial sphere methods and approaches from anthropology, sociology, cultural studies, and media and communication studies, which have produced a significant body of work on everyday socialist and postsocialist practices but have remained under the radar of elite national cultures. They have also stayed in fairly isolated disciplinary brackets and thus badly need postcolonial studies’ sophisticated theorizing of ideology and identity and its commitment to historiography. At the end, I outline three sample possibilities for such a geopolitically expanded, methodologically hybridized encounter: the postcolonial study of popular (post)socialist television; a postcolonial take on the European circulation of socialist film cultures; and contemporary reality television focused on the European underclass.},

The central point of the argument is that the diary illuminates Piesis’s personality, his queer feelings, and mental health struggles, particularly his battle with depression, which had been previously dismissed as mere moodiness rather than a genuine disability. Furthermore, the diary confirms rumours surrounding Piesis’s homosexuality, an important part of his identity, which he tried to suppress and emancipate. The diary offers valuable insights into his personal history. It serves as a testament to the controlling and repressive mechanisms employed by the Soviet authorities during that time. These mechanisms significantly impacted Piesis’s sexual life and artistic freedom, and this article is the first to discover and analyse their effects.},

  abstract = {Drawing on the works of three authors, namely, Jean Epstein, Auguste Villiers de l’Isle-Adam and P.A. Kropotkin, the article attempts to lay the grounds for what might be called a semiotics of forces. Jean Epstein, a filmmaker and theorist of the new art form, is the au­thor of an original concept of photogénie where cinema is presented as an instru­ment re­vealing the transformations of matter itself. Erupting Etna stands for the trans­formations in question. Villiers de l’Isle-Adam is a symbolist writer, who also mentions Etna, associat­ing its explosive power with the chemical formulas of explosives. These formulas, inte­grated into his “least literary” novella, become special signs of social transformation: The writer, challenging the entire class of bourgeoisie that he deeply detests, makes use of the fear incited by the anarchists amongst it. Finally, P.A. Kropotkin, one of the leading theo­rists of anarchism but also an outstanding scientist and geographer, insists on the priority of transformative action over theory and every other speculation. In fact, he proposes his own version of the performative – of words changing the existing state of things – already at the end of the 19th century. In one way or another, all these writers are united by their understanding of the inherent connection between natural and social disasters (Kropotkin’s position is explicit). Described by Epstein and only once mentioned by Villiers de l’Isle-Adam, Etna becomes an element of a correlation, i.e., of a connection that is unapparent and necessary at the same time. What is implied is the relation between volcano and cin­ema as well as that between volcano and explosives. In both cases this relation becomes the designation of matter itself or, to be more exact, of matter in a state of flux and trans­formation. But this is also true of transformative action in the proper sense of the word (re­sulting in revolution, according to Kropotkin), whose verbal expressions always carry within themselves the energy of multidirectional forces. Etna is not merely a volcano and not just an element of a correlation; from the perspective of physics, it is synonymous with heat (scorching lava), which stands for changes in the properties of a substance, i.e., its transformation in purely physical terms. It is clear that transformation in cinema, literature as well as in social life cannot be represented directly; it is revealed only through a set of relations, namely, a semiotics of forces.},

  abstract = {Associating the notion of modernity to coloniality reinforces the question of time in an otherwise space-dominated understanding of colonization as the conquest and exploitation of territories. This article contends that the capitalist West colonized the very concepts of time and historical progress as templates for positioning and evaluating any culture as either modern (civilized) or pre-modern (primitive), while the Soviet East counter-colonized the discourse of temporality with its own version of utopian futurism. Locked by the Cold War in an ‘ideological potlatch’2 and similarly rooted in modernity, the capitalist West and Soviet communism generated different calendars of coloniality but operated with the same logic of forcible modernization and generated structurally similar power relationships. Accordingly, I am pleading for the interpretation of the Romanian (post)communist experience as one of (post)coloniality, wherein modernity is often represented as cultural trauma.3 The paper also illustrates some of the alternative strategies by which postcommunist discourse copes with the trauma of Soviet and Western colonial models that generated syncopated, asynchronous or suspended modernities in recent Romanian history.},

  abstract = {Challenging the scholarship of the chôra, and what has been thought to be a space of absence and différance that cannot reach presence – an idea advocated by Jacques Derrida – John Sallis takes an important turn in his chorology and explores the possibility of manifestation of chôra. Unlike Derrida, for whom “il y a khôra” (there is chôra), Sallis keeps the definite article (the chôra) as an index of certain differentiation in chôra. This article takes as a point of departure Sallis’ thesis regarding the manifestation of the chôra, grounded in the manner in which the chôra is apprehended, that is, as in a dream. Sallis’ interpretation opens up the possibility for a new reading of the dialogue, and offers a tool to examine phenomena occurred in the aftermath of the Platonic cosmogony. One of the most fascinating episodes of the afterlife of the Platonic chôra is the Byzantine chôra, presented in the article as a chorographic performative inscription in the visible, where the iconic inscription/graphê is instrumental in revealing the sacrosanct presence of the Incarnation. Finally, in trying to assess the manifestation of the presence of chôra, the article takes into account the obscure phenomenon of the “replication of the chôra” in the human body. This I will call the “hepatic inscription” of the presence of chôra. A brief assessment will be made around the mantic subjects (the seers), apparently the only human subjects having access to some hidden truth and intimation with the presence of the chôra through divination or inspirational creation.},

They actively participated in indoctrination practices that reflected strict mechanisms of control and censorship and provided prestige and authority in society. This article analyses how local writers in Lithuania who were part of the establishment during late socialism developed a multi-faceted relationship with the system. The perspective of different generations reveals the rise of ethnic (local) interests and the disconnection of everyday life from official goals. It also shows that writers who worked in official channels reduced their participation in indoctrination processes and significantly influenced the mobilisation of national identity.},

During World War II, Estonian researchers had the opportunity to undertake two expeditions to study the Votians, close linguistic relatives, whom they had previously been unable to visit for political reasons. These expeditions took place with the permission and backing of German security and military authorities, which has raised the question of their collaboration. In this article, however, I argue that the research interests of Estonian ethnographers and the Nazi aims of racial studies overlapped only a little.},

Even though Latour and Rancière differ considerably in their theoretical and political orientations, each of them revisits the question of ‘who can speak?’ in order to examine the ways in which speechless entities gain a voice, thereby becoming intelligible as political entities. In this article, I confront Rancière’s reservations about nonhumans as political agents, showing how Latour offers pathways beyond Rancière’s apparent bias towards the human, a bias that is, I argue, fundamentally contradictory to the latter’s broader conceptualization of politics as aesthetics.

The tensions between memory politics and personal experiences expressed in biographical accounts will also be explored.

It is shown, how collective memory, (re)created by rituals of communicative~memory, participates in the (re)construction of national identity as well as tendencies of heroisation~and mythologisation, cases of deconstruction, demythologisation (Suodumas, Gavelis). It is claimed~that canonical impersonate expression forms of nationality and national heroes (Lačplėsis, Rainis), i.e.~general cultural universals, expressions of national ideals dominate in Latvian reflections. The pantheon~of individual national heroes is more fragmented and scattered in Lithuanian reflections and participates~in communicative memory more passively than in Latvian. But here self-reflection and representation~of exiles as collective national heroes is much more intensive           ,              Straipsnyje, remiantis 1988–1992-ųjų metų lietuvių literatūrinio savaitraščio~Literatūra ir menas, mėnraščio~Pergalė~(nuo 1991 m. –~Metai) bei jiems analogiškų latvių~Literatūra un Māksla~ir~Karogs~tekstais, aptariami ir gretinami būdingiausi lietuvių bei latvių to meto tautinės savirefleksijos epizodai, tautinės tapatybės kaitos ir tęstinumo judesiai. Parodoma, kaip tautinės tapatybės (re)konstravime dalyvauja komunikaciniais atminties ritualais (at)kuriama kolektyvinė atmintis. Tekstų pavyzdžiais iliustruojamos herojizavimo ir mitologizavimo tendencijos, dekonstravimo, demitologizavimo atvejai (Dzintaras Suodumas, Ričardas Gavelis). Teigiama, kad latvių refleksijose dominuoja kanoninės įasmenintos tautiškumo raiškos formos, individualizuoti tautiniai herojai (Lačplėsis, Rainis) – visuotini kultūriniai universumai, tautinių idealų išraiškos. Lietuvių refleksijose individualių tautinių herojų „panteonas“ fragmentiškesnis, labiau išsiskaidęs ir komunikacinėje atmintyje dalyvauja pasyviau nei latvių. Tačiau lietuvių spaudoje pastebima žymiai intensyvesnė tremtinių-kolektyvinio tautinio herojaus savirefleksija ir reprezentacija.},

A coherent narrative of national history together with collective memories are inseparable from the ideology of nationalism that flourished in East Central Europe in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries (Benedict Anderson). But we also have to emphasize that the impact of patriotism on a society can be compared to the ambivalent deconstructionist idea of the pharmacon, suggesting that medicine used in too great a dose may become poison. Therefore, the deconstructionist’s suspicion of national mythology and static national identity does not weaken national health, as may appear at the first glance, but may actually strengthen it.},

  author = {Juzala, Gustaw},
  abstract = {The present article focuses on the issue of references to folklore and mythology present in contemporary art in Latvia and Lithuania. Any scholar analysing Baltic cultures or even a person visiting Lithuania or Latvia for the first time and wishing to learn something about the culture of these countries will quickly notice that it contains a kind of a ‘folklore paradigm’ present in all aspects of everyday life, as well as in modern literature, music and visual arts. Folklore and the old world-views connected with it infiltrate professional art through various channels: (1) Subconsciously, as a part of spiritual experience, ancient beliefs still present in everyday life; (2) Consciously or subconsciously through traditional culture, which includes mythology as a ‘cultural relic’; (3) Consciously, if the artist makes deliberate references to mythology, studies it to find the answer to the eternal question of the meaning of life and conveying this meaning through works of art. Each day takes us further away from the times when mythology and folklore were the only means of conveying thoughts on the world and humankind as a whole. Nonetheless, folklore still inspires Lithuanian and Latvian artists. The ‘high culture’ of these countries, created by educated people, repeatedly returns to the motif of the lost Baltic paradise, the archetypical pagan community. Unfortunately, Lithuanian and Latvian literature is still relatively unknown in Poland and in the world, possibly due to its hermetic nature. The modern music and visual arts created by Baltic peoples are widely known and valued abroad, yet their literature is very difficult to translate, not as much because of linguistic concerns, but due to the frequent use of references to folklore and mythology that make these texts incomprehensible to people who lack knowledge about these cultures.},

Currently, there is an intention on the part of Lithuania’s political authorities to remove this apparently dissonant monument. Its presence – and/or removal – raises more than a few issues of sustainability, including those of the socio-cultural environment, policy(ies) for heritage, and matters pertaining to the legal system. Accordingly, the paper analyses this particular example of Lithuania’s dissonant heritage by reference to the relevant literature, and also by presenting historical aspects of both the cemetery and the memorial. The opinions of the cemetery’s visitors concerning the Soviet memorial are also analysed. The empirical research covers the purposive group of Antakalnis cemetery visitors during All Soul’s Day (2 November 2022).},

Looking specifically at the legitimating functions of ideology, the article contests this generalization. In doing so, it proposes the concept of ideological interpellation to clarify the relationship between doctrine and regime legitimation. The author argues that interpellation –the construction of the ideal Soviet subject, in a way that sustained the relations of domination and production – was a consistent goal throughout the last decade of communist rule. However, while the party approached interpellation in different ways, it was unable to resolve official ideology’s rigidity and narrowness of appeal. These conclusions are supported by a discourse analysis of the 26th, 27th, and 28th CPSU congress proceedings.},

(Mis juhtus Andres Lapeteusega, Estonia, 1966), a film that marked the directing debut of Russian-Estonian theatre and film director Grigori Kromanov, as a cinematographic narrative that follows the development of a homo sovieticus. The concept of homo sovieticus, initially simply an ironic reference to the “New Soviet Man” promoted in the official Soviet vocabulary, was elaborated in the 1980s and 1990s by several thinkers and writers from Eastern Europe into a concept allowing for a more analytical description of the bureaucratic human type that developed under the Soviet regime. The German- American philosopher Hannah Arendt in her renowned The Origins of Totalitarianism (1951) found that the juridical, the moral, and the individual in a man could most effectively be killed in concentration camps. The Russian philosopher Aleksandr Zinoviev and the Polish philosopher Józef Tischner, however, have seen the homo sovieticus syndrome as resulting from spiritual rather than physical imprisonment. Predisposed by the planned Soviet economy, which did not motivate Soviet people to make any creative, intellectual, or moral efforts, homo sovieticus soon started to represent a certain official ritualistic behaviour that maintained the symbolic legitimacy of power.             What Happened to Andres Lapeteus? tells the story of an ambitious young Estonian official during Stalinist and post-Stalinist years, but does it in a novel way for its time, tackling the popular criticism of the cult of personality in the Thaw era from the viewpoint of individual responsibility. Offering a charismatic black-and-white version of the novel The Case of Andres Lapeteus (Andres Lapeteuse juhtum, 1963) by the Estonian writer Paul Kuusberg, Kromanov’s new wave film still makes us ponder the often avoided and delicate issue of the Sovietisation of the Baltic states from the inside.},

By elaborating this corpus of texts and detecting and scrutinizing different facets of space representation, we ask questions in regard to the possibilities, as well as potential predicaments of the use of the methodology of digital humanities when applied to the interpretation of literary texts. We are especially interested in the representations of enlargement of geographical space in the novels and the ways in which the literary representations are linked to historical and social events. In the final part, , we discuss how the outcomes of digital analysis play a part in the process of canon-building in Latvian literature, and what similarities and differences prevail in texts included in the literary canon and in those remaining on the periphery. The conclusion further relates these issues to the nationbuilding process of the nineteenth- and early twentieth-century Latvia.},

The focus of this investigation is on the series of novels which deal with twentieth-century history and memory in Latvia. Due to the fact that the chosen texts attempt an evaluation of the Soviet past, an attention is paid to those aspects of representation of the everyday which considerably distinguish contemporary fiction from literary works created during the period of socialist realist dominance. The importance of history and of different everyday practices in forming specific features of national identity is also seen in the context of the attempts of contemporary authors to discover and define themselves as part of today’s global community as they try to position themselves within world literature. In this perspective, the contemporary as well as the historical experience of the Baltic nations testifies to the common roots of European society helping to build bridges between different ethnic and social groups and their members.},

  abstract = {This article examines scholarly debates that cast Soviet policies for the emancipation of women in Central Asia as instances of colonial domination, as the modernizing endeavours of a revolutionary state or as combinations of both and takes them to task for overlooking the gendered consequences of the ‘Soviet paradox’. This paradox is evident in the combined and contradictory operations of a socialist paternalism that supported and legitimized women’s presence in the public sphere (through education, work and political representation), with a command economy and nationalities policy that effectively stalled processes of social transformation commonly associated with modernity. Post-Soviet gender ideologies do not represent a simple return to national traditions, interrupted by Soviet policies, but constitute a strategic redeployment of notions of cultural authenticity in the service of new ideological goals. The politics of gender, thus, plays a crucial role in signalling both a break from the Soviet past and in creating new imaginaries of the nation that enhance social solidarity in increasingly fractured post-Soviet societies. The official endorsement of Islam, as a central tenet of national identity and the simultaneous rejection and policing of its more radical expressions contributes further to the politicization of gender, while the promotion of gender equality by the international donor community carries limited credibility in a context where the core of women’s former claims to citizenship—through welfare entitlements and social protection by the state—has been thoroughly eroded.},

Популярные дис- курсы памяти о коллективной травме и советском колониализме, отражен- ные в официально декларируемых целях подобных экспозиций, тем не менее не могут быть воспроизве- дены в эстетическом опыте посети- теля музея. Для обоснования этого тезиса используется двойная мето- дологическая оптика: историческая реконструкция предполагаемого эстетического воздействия мону- мента в том месте, для которого он создавался; аналитика субъектив- ного опыта посетителя и механизмов его конструирования. На основа- нии анализа делаются выводы о том, что монументальная скульптура, какими бы ни были ее материаль- ная форма, художественная ценность и идеологическое значение в про- шлом, — это прежде всего арт-объект и экспонат, что делает ее потенци- ально привлекательным объектом коллекционирования. Связь между материальной фор- мой монумента и его идеологическим содержанием является историч- ной, она обусловлена пространством коллективных коммеморативных практик и соответствующих им дис- курсов групповой идентичности. Для советских монументов это пре- жде всего городские пространства: площадь, проспект, сквер. Изме- нение пространства воздействия монумента трансформирует эсте- тический и социальный опыт, отме- няя его идеологическое содержание, в зависимости от экспозиционных обстоятельств. Для описания про- цесса присвоения советского мону- ментального наследия посредством перемещения объектов из публичных городских пространств в естествен- ный (парковый) ландшафт вводится понятие «натурализация». Способ консервации объектов монументаль- ной пропаганды в ландшафтной среде может быть позитивно осмыслен и описан как ретроспектива нацио- нальной школы монументальной пластики.},

This article brings to light an early attempt to practice environmentally affirmative design in the USSR: a design program for nationwide recycling infrastructure, launched in Leningrad in 1979. Drawing on archival sources, it shows how a team of Leningrad designers expressed a distinctly socialist approach to sustainability through a comprehensive visual form: the approach based on citizen responsibility as much as on the role of material objects as agents of social change. This never-implemented design program is considered here not as yet another socialist utopia, but as an original vision of mass mobilization through design, informed by the legacy of Russian avant-garde as much as by current Western design trends.},

Предметом рассмотрения становятся научно-фантастические тексты, мелодраматические фильмы, журнальная публицистика, мемориальные нарративы и «места памяти» и другие городские публичные практики, так или иначе работающие с экзистенциальной проблематикой. Автора при этом прежде всего интересует тема утопии, официальное отношение к которой на протяжении советской истории не было однозначным и неоднократно менялось.

Raksta autors ar šādu nolūku piedāvā pārlūkot astoņus teorētiskos princi- pus, kurus no folkloristikas vēstures Britu Impērijā savulaik ir atvedi- nājusi pētniece Sadhana Naithani. Baltijas postkoloniālisms ir pieeja, kas ļautu šos principus adaptēt Baltijas un citu postsociālisma valstu folkloristikas vēstures pētniecībai. Tas radītu instrumentu kopumu padziļinātai nozares vēstures analīzei, stingru teorētisko pamatu, ko sniedz pārskatīta postkoloniālās teorija, un jēdzieni, kas ļauj precīzi attēlot pagātnes daudznozīmīgās un pretrunīgās atbalsis pētniecībā mūsdienās. Vienlaikus Baltijas postkoloniālisma pieejas plašam lieto- jamam ir vismaz četri ievērojami šķēršļi: teorijas fragmentārā uzbūve, bieža jēdzieniskā neskaidrība un sarežģītība, problemātisks rašanās un pielietojuma laiks, un ideoloģiskais tēls mērķa valstīs.},

Theoretical arguments for more multiplex historiography ground the work, followed by an overview of women’s situation during the transition paralleled to an analysis of changing discourse in magazine Soviet Woman, later – Woman. The final part presents the masterminds behind the analyzed discourse through interviews with editors-inchief of the time. The study concludes that a magazine is an important actor in cushioning regime changes and helping women adjust, yet yielding to the new political order it acts as its ambassador as well. Finally, a recommendation is made for more complex and intersectional analysis, emphasizing women’s agency in historical processes and the importance of women‘s magazines for social change.},

Все эти «пост» термины функционируют как последовательные маркеры, обо- значая то, что следует после модерна. Постмодернист призывает к новым категориям, способам мысли и письма, ценностей и политики, чтобы преодолеть дефициты модерновых дискурсов и ме- тодов. Показано влияние постмодерна на сферы бизнес управления и образования. Указаны концеп- туальные пороки постмодернистских построений.

  abstract = {This article is based on the observation that the current application of postcolonial theory in Russian studies is limited to analysis of Russian rather than the wider Russophone literature, especially from the southern sphere of the ex-Soviet bloc. I argue that this critical tendency is largely rooted in the peculiar theoretical discourse on Russia’s subaltern and internally colonised identity vis-à-vis the West, a notion that tends to perpetuate Russian orientalist and colonial discourses. Within this narrative, the Russian Empire and the Soviet Union are regarded as non-colonial powers since the Russian population allegedly suffered more under Russo-Soviet rule than non-Russian nationalities in the annexed territories. On the other hand, studies that do accept the Russo-Soviet Empire’s status as colonial examine how Russia has discursively shaped its ‘Orient’, in particular, the nations in the Caucasus and Central Asia, but inevitably privilege Russian literature. I explore the problematic implications of such an exclusive focus on the Russian perspective, question the theoretical conception of Russia as an ‘internal colony’, propose arguments for the consideration of Soviet colonialism in the Caucasus and Central Asia as a variant model of Western colonialism, and emphasise the need for examining Russophone cultures when theorising Russian postcolonial studies.},

Although these two innovations took place in the first quarter of the 20th century, their impact on poetry became evident only much later, and they still influence and shape the contemporary Russian poetry. This article analyzes how these two innovations induced changes in the design of poetic texts and their modes of subjectivity, particularly in contemporary Russian poetry, which regards them at this point not as experiments but as well-established practices. The article offers an exploration of the subject in philosophy which is then applied to a more detailed description of the connections between poetry and cinema since the historical avant-garde (Aleksei Kruchenykh). The essay concludes with a comparative discussion focused on the Russian poetry of the last 25 years (Aleksandr Skidan, Leonid Schwab, Nina Stavrogina).},

  abstract = {This article aims to analyze the resilience of Baltic media systems in the global network environment. Resilience is here defined as media systems’ ability to survive despite the efflux of resources and loss of audiences’ attention and trust, and as the capacity to support a reliable, transparent, and diverse information sphere for the functioning of democracy. Using media market data from Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania, the changes in the media during the last three decades will be analyzed. The analysis concludes that the implementation of media policy currently does not guarantee the resilience of small countries’ media systems.},

  abstract = {Films about irregular migration to Europe that centre on the Mediterranean sea crossing often unwittingly strengthen the regime of migrant (in)visibility furthered by sensationalist media, which include topoi of shipwrecks, dramatic rescues, and body bags. Such films’ imagery of the Mediterranean as a metaphorical space of transformation into living death, actual death, or paradisiacal life also suggests that the identity of the migrant is indeterminable, zombie-like, even monstrous. Finally, focusing on the sea as central to the migrant journey makes invisible the broader geopolitical context, especially the continuing neocolonial relationship between the global North and the global South. My essay examines the political implications of focusing on migrant bodies in the middle of the sea, especially in sympathetic accounts which portray the Mediterranean as a gothic space where the perished yet ghostly migrants haunt Europe like revenants of its colonial past. Gianfranco Rosi’s acclaimed docudrama Fire at Sea (2016) exemplifies this approach. I analyse it in the context of similar visual representations before briefly contrasting it with Želimir Žilnik’s Logbook Serbistan (2015), which situates migrants in a broader geopolitical context and portrays them as non-idealised people with complex backgrounds, political opinions, and agency.},

  abstract = {In the era of hyphenated identities, one’s identity may not be as clear as decades before; the same applies to culture and literature. Over the past years, there have been discussions about the exact definition of national literature. In Estonia there have been debates surrounding the definition of Estonian literature: is it a literature written in Estonian or is it a literature written in Estonia? One of the most interesting literary debates erupted in connection with the Estonian Russian writer Andrei Ivanov (born 1971), whose novels in many cases have been written in Russian but published first in Estonian. The first part of the article deals with the definition of Estonian literature and the position of the Estonian Russian-language literature. It may be noteworthy that only at the beginning of the 21st century did Estonian literary criticism start to deal with the Estonian Russian-language literature as part of Estonian literature. The authors of the younger generation (born in 1970 and later) or the so-called noughts-generation are the first credibly taken authors as part of Estonian literature. The position of Estonian Russian literature has shifted from rejection and periphery to the spotlight. The works by Andrei Ivanov have played an important role in that process. The second part of the article analyses the depiction of Estonian Russians in Ivanov’s A Handful of Dust and Ashes using the branch of comparative literature called imagology or image studies. The Estonian Russian background proves to be a useful tool for creating a character who is alienated, who is an existential outsider. The author deals with existential questions and depicts tendencies in the 21st century society. As many other Estonian Russian writers, Ivanov does not deal specifically with the issues of Estonian Russians and that is one of the reasons of his popularity and one of the reasons why Estonian Russian literature has attracted so much attention.},

  abstract = {The present study seeks to thoroughly investigate and delineate the concept alongside the transformation of landscape as an aesthetic idea. On the one side it runs that nature perceived as landscape remains nothing else but granted, evident or 'natural'. On yet another side, and to some fairly significant extend, this thesis identifies landscape as a sheer idea and concept that is shaped and (re-)mediated in an ongoing process. The thesis examines the role of the observer and brings into agreement that every landscape is a produce of creative mental processes. In brief outline, this approach provides a framework for identifying landscape as being inextricably linked with media from the very beginning of their social and cultural inception. As glowing examples for the paradigmatic shift of the classical subjective vision model culminating in the emergence of a new prototype, the camera obscura, together with the panorama, fortify the prevailing argument that the mode of human sense perception is organised and determined by earlier acquainted recognitions. In this matter, as each and every medium strive after accomplishment, then this accomplishment is substantially determined by overwhelming historic, as well as thriving cultural circumstances. In conclusive terms, this study seeks to show how landscape counts as content of a representation, while simultaneously being a very own medium that specifically carries social, geological as well as historic knowledge. In fact, modern vision shall therefore never be bound to any single format or process, rather it will have to always undergo procedures aiming at reshaping the perceivable. Landscape is playing out its major characteristic, specifically that of being, in essence, a purely intellectual, virtual and synthetic product.},

It considers her life and intellectual development in the context of the significant social and cultural upheavals of the second half of the twentieth century, which still resonate today. Beginning with her early years in Bulgaria and her communist, Orthodox Christian, and Thracian Orphic influences and her training in linguistics and psychoanalysis and subsequent academic career in France (and at Columbia University), Miglena Nikolchina shows how both her theoretical writings and her fiction have been shaped by avant-garde art and literature and their potential for both personal and social transformation. She traces the turning points in her thinking resulting from her encounters with the work of Bakhtin, Marx, Freud, Lacan, Roman Jakobson, Judith Butler, and others and how they shaped her influential contributions to poststructuralism, semiosis, psychoanalysis, feminist theory, and (through her concept of transhumanization) twenty-first-century technological advances in electronic art and artificial intelligence. The recent spy scandal will also be addressed; Kristeva claims that the dossiers shared by the Bulgarian government are in fact records of its surveillance of her"--},

Changes of political regimes were accompanied by revisions to public monuments, which reflected the new power relations. Not always did the authorities topple old monuments and erect new ones. Sometimes economic, ethical, cultural and political imperatives required more subtle methods of causing depreciation to unwanted sculptures and introducing new political messages. This paper explains why sculpture was assigned a special role in political communication, and will conceptualise the peculiarities of this communication in semiotic terms. Among the most popular practices in Latvia are renaming monuments, revising inscriptions, circulating new descriptions, ignoring natural decay and banal vandalism, modifying the environment around a sculpture, and using a sculpture as a centrepiece in various ceremonies.},

  abstract = {Claude lanzmann’s Shoah (1985) is credited with pioneering a new aesthetic for the representation of traumatic memory. Through interviews with the survivors, perpetrators and witnesses to the Holocaust, lanzmann evoked “somatic testimony” to an experience that is said to exceed the representational framework of ordinary speech and narrative. This article traces the parallel development of a similar mode of testimonial representation in the documentary cinema of Soviet lithuania after WWII. In the absence of any clear influence between the national traditions of French and Soviet lithuanian cinema, the observed similarities are suggestive rather of a panEuropean pattern of aesthetic invention, faced with the challenge of coming to terms with the traumatic legacy of WWII.},

The study of entanglements is part of the transnational turn in the humanities and social sciences and has been greatly influenced by postcolonial studies, but it has its own set of topics, problems and questions that it aims to study. Rather than a methodology, the entangled approach is a perspective that looks at its research objects from a new angle and from multiple new levels of analysis. Nonetheless, it has found considerable methodological reflection in different disciplines such as history writing, literary and cultural studies, and memory studies. This introduction goes briefly over some of the disciplinary contexts where the study of entanglements has emerged and their methodological discussions. It also offers some reflections on the nodes of problems related to the interconnectedness of different cultures in the Baltic region that might be successfully approached with the concept of entangled cultures.},

At first evaluated only as a pastime on the margins of serious literature, since Apollinaire it has evolved into a serious genre of poetry and art of its own, and is no longer considered a childish game. Given this situation in contemporary criticism, it is quite a peculiar situation that Latvian literature and literary criticism still does not pay adequate attention to it, thus visual poetry has stayed an outsider genre up to this day.},

Food, both in its quality and quantity, was a powerful tool in the Soviet Union. This collection features work by scholars in an array of fields including cultural studies, literary studies, sociology, history, and food studies, and the work gathered here explores the intersection of gender, food, and culture in the post-1960s Soviet context. From personal cookbooks to gulag survival strategies, Seasoned Socialism considers gender construction and performance across a wide array of primary sources, including poetry, fiction, film, women's journals, oral histories, and interviews. This collection provides fresh insight into how the Soviet government sought to influence both what citizens ate and how they thought about food},

  abstract = {This article examines how intersecting markers of difference shape differentiated whiteness. In so doing, it contributes to scholarship on whiteness and racialization. The authors draw on autoethnographic vignettes from fieldwork in Copenhagen to analyse the emergence of similar-yet-divergent researcher and migrant positionalities. Both authors are female researchers from Baltic countries living in Denmark and often perceived as Eastern Europeans—as not-quite-white and as “Europe’s ‘internal others’”. Both of us conducted fieldwork in the same district of Copenhagen. Mantė carried out research on friendships among teenagersn a racially diverse public school and in youth activity clubs. Linda explored social inclusion and exclusion in contested urban spaces. However, our researcher positionalities played out differently. We analyse how ambiguous, contested and relational notions of (Eastern) Europeanness, together with intersecting racialized, classed and gendered tropes of Eastern European migration, made themselves manifest in our positionings and movements. Through an intersectional analysis of Eastern European racialized positionalities, our discussion of differentiated whiteness highlights how whiteness is intersectionally constituted, multiple and mouldable. These findings serve to nuance research on hegemonic whiteness in the Nordic setting.},

Indeed, the inseparability of democracy and deconstruction confirms this. After setting out some of the pertinent features of ‘democracy to come’ – seen, in part, in the General Will – the notion of political community in the thought of Hannah Arendt is brought into question, if not deconstructed. Political community as presented by Arendt is seen to limit the inclusiveness of democracy. In the final section, the article suggests that Agamben’s critique of the very structure of the nation-state opens the way for a renewal of the notion of the human in the ‘community to come’.},

The aim is to illustrate the way in which the Austinian division between the constative and the performative articulates the meaning-making process in these documentaries. This is done on two levels: on a larger scale the analysis looks at how Bridges of Time serves as a single performative speech act, establishing the Baltic New Wave phenomenon through its own aesthetic style; in a more detailed level, the article examines two examples from the aesthetic movement to demonstrate how they avoid reproducing a given reality by creating a semantic shift away from the surface structure in order to connote a rustic pre-occupation sensibility.},

The latter does not encompass the reality of the literary field because it leaves out authors who write in multiple languages, as well as other manifest and latent expressions of multilingual poetics. In contemporary Estonian poetry, words, phrases, and other linguistic nuances from different languages frequently intertwine with Estonian. By analyzing seven of such multilingual poems from the perspective of literary multilingualism studies, this article will highlight and compare three poetic techniques of code-switching present in contemporary Estonian poetry, pointing out the similarities and differences between such poetic structures and mechanisms of meaning-making.},

  abstract = {In the first part of the paper the author focuses on the way the great historian and thinker Gershom Scholem understood the Lurianic idea of tsimtsum (i.e. divine contraction as the first act of creation) as the key category of Jewish theology. Next, he combines the conceptual structure emerging from the Scholemian understanding of tsimtsum with Jacques Derrida’s analysis of space. He suggests that the Platonic notion of khora as read by Derrida can be identified with the idea of tehiru, i.e. the void that comes into existence as a result of divine contraction. In the second part of the paper the author extends the equation even further by pointing out how the notion of khora-tehiru can be fruitfully combined with the idea of the “Freudian void,” the space created by the separation of the mother from the child in Freudian analysis of the emergence of the human subject. One of the benefits of such a conceptual merge is that the Scholemian/Derridean/Freudian space thus understood can be seen as permeated with a complex affective and libidinal dynamic. Drawing on various post-Freudian psychoanalytic theorists (Lacan, Klein, Winnicott, Green), the author proceeds to analyze this dynamic, focusing on the notions of mourning, anxiety and desire.},

  abstract = {In 1956, a prominent faction within the leadership of Soviet Latvia, the Latvian national communists, launched two ambitious initiatives designed to redress perceived Stalinist Russification polices – a language law and residency restrictions. This article examines and evaluates these two policies and asks if they were part of a “Latvianization” program that deliberately targeted Russians for denial of residency permits and required Russians to gain Latvian-language competency within a two-year timeframe or face the threat of dismissal. In an effort to restore the primacy of the Latvian language, the national communists created a law enforcing knowledge of Latvian and Russian for Communist Party and government functionaries and service sector personnel. Using the Soviet legal system, the national communists also attempted to halt the influx of predominantly Slavic immigration to the Latvian capital, Riga. By instituting passport restrictions on settling in the city, the national communists sought to limit Slavic migration in order to maintain Riga's Latvian character and reduce pressure on the city's housing supply and municipal services. Existing studies deem passport restrictions in other Soviet cities a failure. The author argues, however, that the national communists’ scheme was generally successful, dramatically curbing migration to Riga during its operation.},

  abstract = {Our memories can put their signatures on handmade products and the way an object is made can colour our emotional response to it. I use handmade pullovers by Ms Sirkka Könönen, the textile artist, and anonymous traditional pullovers from Korsnäs and Ostrobothnia as examples and ask how these products convey memories. To shed light on the phenomenon I use a ‘product essence analysis’. Relying on Charles S. Peirce’s theory and his categories of ‘Firstness’, ‘Secondness’ and ‘Thirdness’ I have formulated three stages to describe how to observe a product: ‘first impression’, ‘factual’ and ‘interpretation’. The product is interpreted as a semiotic base in which various signs and signcombinations become anchored. Part of the interpretation is to look how these products serve memory. Pullovers from the Korsnäs district have drawn much attention because of their visual qualities. The Jussi pullover (known by this name because of a character in a play) is associated with notions of self-reliance and is perceived as a symbol of a special way of being a man and a Finn. Users are fascinated by Könönen’s pullovers and, when using them, experience their share of the glow. Pullovers convey collective memories of being Finnish. Pullovers are also very private objects and convey memories of the maker or the giver and of the relation to the owner’s life story.},

  abstract = {In light of the theme and concerns of the present collection of essays, we may ask whether ‘distance in general’, and ‘critical distance in particular’ (Fredric Jameson), has truly disappeared with postmodernity. Proposing an immediate and interruptive political engagement with local issues, Jacques Rancière’s articulation of political mobilisation does seem to confirm this claim. Upon further inspection, however, his emancipatory politics repeat the same mistake of valuing an abstract universal at the expense of a concrete particular, however paradoxical this may seem at first sight. The present article develops this thesis in three moments. On the first hand, it highlights Rancière’s notion of conflict as being institutive of politics. Secondly, it connects this ‘sensible’, and Rancière’s understanding of politics as being aesthetic, to Kant’s ‘Transcendental Aesthetics’. The French author sees in the leading section of the first Critique the grounding possibility of (I) freeing up time and space within the social realm; (II) the representation of a common political surface that can be reshaped; (III) political equality; (IV) emancipation. The last section shows how this recourse to the transcendental subject in Rancière’s politics follows and embraces a traditional position in the history of philosophy whereby identity is denigrated at the profit of a disembodied universalism.},

  abstract = {The article explores the notion of the State: first, as a philosophical concept; second, as a topic in the current socio-political discussion of democratization and globalization; and third, as a possible element of a left wing ideological program. In the prevailing understanding, the State is a regrettable technical necessity that should be kept to a minimum and that will gradually expire by itself. Both the orthodox and the Althusserian Marxists agree with liberals and neo-liberals on this. Their value preferences fuse with their diagnosis of actual tendencies. However, the article claims that, from the current leftist, social-democratic and post-Marxist point of view, the State is becoming stronger but there is nothing bad in that.This post-Marxist point of view coincides with the position of Karl Marx himself when he was a young man planning to write a critique of the State. That project was never completed, but what we have of it, A Contribution to the Critique of Hegel’s Philosophy of Right, shows that a truly democratic state itself constitutes democratic society and thus forms a circle of mutual establishment and mutual authorization. The democratic form becomes the content; and everyone takes part in self-government, while socio-economic institutions in turn acquire a political nature. The article concludes with a brief account of the principles for the constitutional structure of such a state.},

  abstract = {This volume, now in its second and revised edition, deals with the legal status of the three Baltic States - Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania - as a consequence of the illegality of the Soviet annexation in 1940-1991. It offers a detailed historical overview of the Soviet takeover of the Baltic States in 1939/1940 and analysis of international law as it was in force, also regionally and bilaterally, at the time. It examines the role of the continuity of the diplomatic representations of the Baltic States and other manifestations of the Western non-recognition of the Soviet annexation. Moreover, the book examines the nature of the restoration of the Baltic States in 1991 based on their State continuity claim. It also studies in detail questions such as borders, citizenship and reparation claims, and asks to what extent State continuity could or could not be restored in practice. Compared to the first edition, the text has been updated (for example, on developments regarding border treaties) but also more background references have been added on the history of the Baltic States, Soviet and post-Soviet Russian responses to the continuity claim of the Baltic States, etc. The book interprets the Soviet annexation and Baltic States' continuity case against the wider backdrop of developments in international law in the 20th century and argues that the outcome reflected important normative developments in international law, away from mere effectivity. The case of the Baltic States will be relevant for current and future cases of illegal annexation, following the threat and use of military force prohibited under international law},

One of the means of measurement of culture-specificity is its translation into other languages. In the present study, the Parallel English-Lithuanian Corpus, compiled at the Centre of Computational Linguistics of Vytautas Magnus University, was used as the basis for checking the translations of the word right. Both quantitative and qualitative methods of research were applied in distinguishing the senses of the English word right and its correspondences in Lithuanian as well as making some inferences regarding the possible cultural differences. The research findings show that while the concept of the English word right is based on respect for rational thinking, logical deductions, and evidence, the Lithuanian correspondences are associated more with metaphysical truth and the dichotomy between GOOD and BAD.},

The aim of this article is therefore to attempt an initial approach to a new subject in relation to post‐Soviet Russian culture. The first part will define my use of the terms “gender,”“citizenship,” and “empire,” in order to explain my underlying assumptions. It will then discuss some of the theoretical and methodological problems they engender in relation to contemporary Russian society and culture. The second part will present a brief analysis of how these issues have been treated in post‐Soviet literature by both men and women, particularly in writings of the twenty‐first century. The main focus will be on prose fiction and               publitsistika               (social and political journalism) by Russian writers, but reference will also be made to particularly important films, television series, and discussions in the media where they are relevant to the argument. The article will attempt to demonstrate that whereas the dominant discourses in contemporary Russian culture and the media are patriarchal and nationalistic, a few women writers in post‐Soviet Russia have had some success in challenging the traditional “symbolic order” in their culture in relation to women, gender and nation.},

Landscape photographs are abundant with cultural codes implicated in visual structures of landscapes, which are read and distinguished with the help of the palimpsest model. An interdisciplinary methodological approach is applied to the understanding of the functioning of photography in the spatial and local planes and to the purposeful use of the concepts of               place               and               space               , combining the phenomenological insights of humanistic geography, the theory of spatial production of the sociologist Henri Lefebvre, and the art historical analysis of visual texts. This interdisciplinary study introduces the cultural layer that is characteristic of the 20th century landscape, provides a sense of historical time shifts, and clarifies the prevailing stylistic movements in photographic landscapes.},

@thesis{meiorgGenderNationRecent,
  title = {Gender and {{Nation}} in {{Recent Estonian Historiography}}},
  author = {Meiorg, Marianne},
  institution = {Central European University},
  abstract = {The thesis analyses recent Estonian historiography in the period of the Estonian national movement from 1905 to 1918. In particular, I analyse sections from two texts, one representing an RXWVLGHU¶V view of Estonian history, the author being a Finnish historian, and the other representing an LQVLGHU¶V view, being compiled by a group of Estonian historians. The aim is to investigate the role gender plays in these historical narratives. I draw on the theoretical framework by Joan Scott and other feminist scholars who have analysed gender in the construction of nation, in particular. The analysis shows how the text by Estonian authors, which (re)creates Estonian national narrative, is (re)constructing Estonian national identity as masculine, constructed in a binary relationship with femininity and a certain, less desirable masculinity. The text does so by relying on the (heterosexual) familial iconography, whereby a paternal figure, representing hegemonic masculinity, is the head of the family, leading, guiding and protecting the wife/mother and the children. In the same text by Estonian historians, hegemonic masculinity is represented by the male leaders of the national movement, who are presented as active, progressive, independent and self-sufficient, intelligent, peaceful, and ethical. This positive image is created in contrast to the feminised image of the Baltic-Germans, who ruled the territory that later became Estonia for 700 years, and the image of (tsarist) Russians as aggressively masculine, images that are somewhat complicated in the other text I analysed, by the Finnish historian. The text by the Estonian historians largely portrays women and feminised Baltic-Germans as helpless and passive, in need of a paternal figure. Due to the association of socialism with Russia, the Estonian socialist movement is depicted as aggressively masculine. The language of sexual difference also defined the BalticGermans as a non-threat while Russians are constructed as an ongoing threat that must be constrained, along with the socialist movement.},

  abstract = {Industrialisation facilitates social and economic change and its role in modifying population patterns via the process of urbanisation is well documented. The socially selective nature of population redistribution is widely recognised, but in multi-ethnic states this redistribution of population is also culturally selective and has important rami®cations for ethnic relations. This paper suggests that the theory of Internal Colonialism remains a useful theoretical framework for explaining the changes seen in Soviet Estonia. Speci®cally, it examines the in¯uence of industrialisation on patterns of immigration into Estonia, and their consequent impact on Estonia’s ethnic geography. We conclude that industrialisation is an important factor in¯uencing patterns of population movement and distribution and that internal colonialism provides a valuable framework for the analysis of societal change in Soviet Estonia, and in other socialist contexts.},

We insist that the debate on communism must reckon with three unavoidable issues: property, internationalism, and subjectivity. In considering the mutual implication of these issues, and in discussing the related topics of political representation and the state, the article contends that communist politics today must remain open to the past, translate between different struggles, and construct an autonomy grounded in social being.},

Estonian culture and literature suddenly became divided into two parts. The political terror imposed restrictions on literature in homeland and the national ideology limited literature in the initial years of exile. Both were closed communities and were monolingual systems in a cultural sense because these systems avoided dialogue and the influence of other signs. It was a traumatic experience for nation and culture where the totalitarian political power and trauma have allied. The normal cultural communication was destroyed. But the most important thing at this time was memory, not just memory but entangled memory, which emigrants carried with them to the new homeland and which influenced people in Estonia. The act of remembering becomes crucial in the exile cultures.},

  abstract = {Colonization influences the colonized country politically, economically and culturally, and colonial traces persist everywhere in a colonized society, particularly in social manners, behaviour and culture. After a period of colonization, a period of decolonization is needed. According to W. D. Mignolo, decolonization is the long-term processes involving the bureaucratic, cultural, linguistic, and psychological divesting of colonial power. The result of decolonization is a new people and community. The processes involved depend on cultural transfer, cultural relations and modernisation of smaller and peripheral national cultures. All of these processes make it possible for small and peripheral nations to find their own originality within European culture. An “external” or “alien” culture may function as a metatext in an “own” culture and it can describe the “own” culture itself via auto-communication. The literary works of smaller national cultures, such as Estonia and Latvia, represent cultural processes in the process of modernisation and the modernist period in literature at the beginning of the 20th century and also in the 21st century. The paper analyses different texts from “alien” cultures (Shakespeare’s Hamlet, the Bible etc.) which function as metatexts in “own” culture. Shakespeare’s Hamlet as a literary figure has been a very important and influential motif in Estonian literature and culture: Gustav Suits’s and Paul-Eerik Rummo’s poems used the motif of Hamlet to describe Estonian history and culture. The Bible has influenced Estonian literary culture for a long time. The function of the old biblical myths is to create the eternal, mythical dimension in literary works and create contact with old nations (e.g. Käsu Hans’, Juhan Liiv’s and Ene Mihkelson’s poetry.). Prose writers Rūdolfs Blaumanis’ and Eduard Vilde’s works represent the Baltic lifestyle, which affected peasants and aristocrats in different ways. Both writers used more of their “own” cultural system and language as metatext to describe the cultural system, rather than using external cultural systems and languages. They transformed realist, romantic and psychological realist styles and languages into internal or “own” cultural systems.},

Analiza dotyczy trzech najciekawszych dzieł artysty zrealizowanych w Litewskim Studiu Filmowym: Ostatni strzał (Paskutinis šūvis, 1959), Dziewczynka i echo (Mergaitė ir aidas, 1964), Ślicznotka (Gražuolė, 1969). Autorka ukazuje kontekst formowania się filmów w systemie ideologicznych wymogów, omawia poetycko-formalny styl wizualny filmów oraz opisuje obraz dziecka o szczególnej wyobraźni, wrażliwości i liryzmie. Dokładne przyjrzenie się filmom pozwala stwierdzić, że forma i poetycka stylistyka filmów były wynikiem nastrojów odwilżowych i estetycznych zmian formalnych w kinematografii sowieckiej, a dominujący w filmach szczególny punkt widzenia z perspektywy dziecka odsłaniał prawdy, które w inny sposób, w innej konwencji byłoby znacznie trudniej wyrazić. Symboliczny język filmów litewskiego reżysera poświadczał, że i dziecięcy bohater może być znakomitym narzędziem perswazji, metaforą współczesnych faktów dziejowych, że cechuje go tajemniczość i przynależność do kręgu mitów.},

  abstract = {The British sociologist Gerard Delanty's conception of "boundary and identities of exclusion" in European history shall be remembered when approaching "hard borders." This concept takes into account the "cultural dynamics of self-identification through exclusion" and is germane when considering the interwar interactions between the countries of the Baltic area and Russia. The works of Reece Jones and Alec Murphy on "the hardening of borders" and "the fetishization of territory" as national traits are equally pertinent to the perception of frontiers during the duration of the 20th century, including the years 1917 to 1922. In every occasion in which war and violence (ultimatums, threats of force) were employed in the Baltic Sea Region to award borders in favor of one state or another or to settle accounts, the arrangements were not permanent and a cycle of warfare with terrible effects on local people followed. The combination of universalist ideologies (such as Communism) with imperial goals frequently resulted in both domestic and international conflicts. Civil unrest (sisällissota) and clashes with and between foreign troops (Russian and German) marked Finland's journey to independence. Comparable conditions existed in Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania. In each case, the upshot was not just an obsession with boundaries, but also an increase in otherness and loss of life.},

For example, new media technologies offer the possibility of constructing a polemical and critical picture of social reality through cinematic devices and communicating with a wider national audience. Referring to three examples – the Lithuanian art house film, Šarūnas Bartas’s production Eastern Drift, and a popular reinterpretation of the myth about a noble Lithuanian bandit, Tadas Blinda. The Legend Is Born – the author points to problems postSoviet Lithuanian society faces in dealing with its own critical reflection. The major problem, the lack of skills in the new media languages and technologies, results in “mimic realities” that make it difficult to negotiate major social issues on a popular level and places film outside public matters.},

  abstract = {SUMMARY: David Chioni Moore revisits his seminal essay, “Is the Post- in Post-colonial the Post- in Post-Soviet? Toward a Global Postcolonial Critique” (2001), from the perspective of 2024. His return to the topic is prompted by the fact that debates on the postcolonial are far from over and that world events since 2001 (and especially since February 24, 2022) have variously altered, refuted, and reinforced many of the propositions he first made. Moore starts with a review of what the words “post-,” “colonial,” and “postcolonial” mean, highlighting how the term “postcolonial” came into widespread academic use, even fashion, in the West between 1988 and 1992. He then weighs the term “post-Soviet” against its frequently used alternatives “postcommunist” and “postsocialist.” Next, Moore overviews the wide variations in postcolonial fortunes in the post-Soviet world that attempt to avoid uniformity. He characterizes NATO and the European Union as decolonial accelerators and revisits what he had termed in 2001 as the “double silence”: whereas post-Sovietists avoided postcolonial discussions, postcolonialists avoided the Russo-Soviet expanse. He offers an explanation for why, more than two decades later, only the second kind of silence remains. In the last section of the essay, Moore addresses the return of Russian imperial-colonial war, the horrors of war in Ukraine, and he provides a comparison with Kenya, also discussing postcolonial studies’ differential responses to the recent cataclysms in Gaza and Ukraine. Резюме: Дэвид Чиони Мур возвращается к своей известной статье 2001 г. “Совпадают ли пост- в постколональном с пост- в постсоветском? На пути к глобальной постколониальной критике”. Среди мотивов возвра-щения к старому тексту – непрекращающиеся теоретические дискуссии о постколониальном, с одной стороны, и события в мире, особенно по-сле 24 февраля 2022 г., с другой. Эти факторы, считает Мур, заставляют пересмотреть высказанные им в 2001 г. идеи, принимая и развивая те, что прошли проверку временем, и отказываясь от других. Статья начинается с анализа семантики категорий “пост-”, “колониальный” и “постколониальный”. Мур показывает, как сформировалась мода на термин “постколониальность” в академической среде на Западе между 1988 и 1992 гг.; разбирает семантику и практику применения категории “постсоветский” в сравнении с наиболее распространенными ее аль-тернативами – “посткоммунистический” и “постсоциалистический”; и прослеживает основные траектории постколониальности на пост-советском пространстве. Мур видит в НАТО и Европейском Союзе основные факторы деколонизации в регионе и пересматривает свой тезис 2001 г. о “двойном умолчании”: постсоветском игнорировании постколониальной рамки и постколониальном игнорировании постсо-ветского опыта. По его мнению, сегодня можно говорить о сохранении только второго аспекта “двойного умолчания”. В заключительной ча-сти статьи Мур рассуждает о возвращении имперской–колониальной стратегии России и ужасах войны в Украине, сравнивая эту ситуацию с ситуацией в Кении. Также он размышляет о различиях в реакции постколониальных исследований на войну в Газе и в Украине.},

Yet Russia and the successor Soviet Union exercised colonial control over the Caucasus, Central Asia, the Baltics, and Central and Eastern Europe for anywhere from fifty to two hundred years. The present essay interrogates the possible postcoloniality of the post-Soviet sphere, including Russia. The investigation is complicated by Russia's seeming Eurasian status and its history of perceived cultural inferiority to the West. A broad range of theoretical, historical, cultural, and geographic positions are examined, and figures such as Curzon, Conrad, Lermontov, and Shohat are addressed. In conclusion the essay argues against the current occidentocentric privileging of Western European colonization as the standard and proposes a fully global postcolonial critique. Overall, it critiques both too narrow post-Soviet studies and too parochial, too Anglo-Franco-focused postcolonial studies.},

  abstract = {В статье освещаются достижения советской исторической науки 1940-1960 годов в исследовании проблемы коллективизации в прибалтийских республиках. Новизна исследования заключается в том, что автором впервые выполнен обзор советской исторической литературы, посвященной коллективизации в Прибалтике, с современных научных позиций. Рассматривается советская историческая парадигма, выявляются факторы ее формирования, эрозии и кризиса в 1970-1980 годах, который приведет к воссозданию научных школ, в том числе и национальных, в 1990-2000 годах. Актуальность исследования связана, с одной стороны, с осмыслением опыта развития собственно исторической науки и пути, пройденного ею в XX веке, с другой - с необходимостью на современном этапе изучать коллективизацию в западных республиках и районах после Великой Отечественной войны в связи с нарастающими противоречиями на постсоветском пространстве, питательной средой для которых становится тенденциозное использование фактов из истории СССР. Проведенный анализ позволяет выявить достижения советской исторической науки 1940-1960 годов (выделение этапов, факторов и методов коллективизации) и слабоизученные проблемы (цель коллективизации, методы и масштаб крестьянского сопротивления, число и дальнейшая судьба раскулаченных, наличие и характер нарушений при проведении сплошной коллективизации и «раскулачивания»).},

  abstract = {Carving up the world into Global North and Global South has become an established way of thinking about global difference since the end of the Cold War. This binary, however, erases what this paper calls the Global East – those countries and societies that occupy an interstitial position between North and South. This paper problematises the geopolitics of knowledge that has resulted in the exclusion of the Global East, not just from the Global North and South, but from notions of globality in general. It argues that we need to adopt a strategic essentialism to recover the Global East for scholarship. To that end, it traces the global relations of IKEA’s bevelled drinking glass to demonstrate the urgency of rethinking the Global East at the heart of global connections, rather than separate from them. Thinking of such a Global East as a liminal space complicates the notions of North and South towards more inclusive but also more uncertain theorising.},

  author = {Navickaitė, Rasa},
  abstract = {This dissertation presents a transnational biography and reception history of Marija Gimbutas (1921-1994) – a renowned Lithuanian-American archaeologist, and an advocate of the theory of the peaceful, egalitarian, gynocentric and Goddess-centered prehistoric civilization of “Old Europe”. Gimbutas’ utopian antimodernist vision became a source of inspiration for a variety of socio-political movements (environmentalist, feminist, neo-pagan, among others) in diverse geographical contexts, on both sides of and transgressing the “Iron Curtain”, starting with the 1970s and reaching a peak during the 1990s. This dissertation analyzes how Gimbutas’ work and persona were received, constructed and appropriated, and sometimes rejected, in diverse contexts, namely, archaeology and feminist archaeology, the feminist spirituality movement in the United States and post-socialist Lithuanian feminism. The dissertation combines historical methods with theoretical perspectives developed in feminist and postcolonial/postsocialist studies to produce a critical account of Gimbutas’ life and work, as well as to discuss how various actors have related to and made use of her ideas. In doing so, it sheds light on some questions of broader theoretical and historiographical significance for feminism and critical gender scholarship transnationally. Examining feminist activist and scholarly engagement with Gimbutas’ controversial vision of Old Europe, this dissertation reveals some of the “political ambivalence” inherent to feminism, considered as simultaneously a product and a critique of modernity. In particular, this dissertation interrogates questions of scientific objectivity, gender essentialism, and Eurocentrism, as they appear in the feminist debates and gender politics, centered around Gimbutas’ work and persona. Focusing on the figure of Gimbutas this dissertation challenges the narrative of Western feminism as “the norm”, and Eastern Europe as only a recipient of feminist ideas and politics. Instead, it proposes an alternative history, where women’s politics both in “the East” and “the West” have been shaped by the Cold War division of the world, and continue to be affected by other transnational hierarchies, divisions and encounters. Much of the interest in Gimbutas’ theory of Old Europe can be understood as a symptom of the general disappointment with the traditional ideologies of the Left and Right around the time of the fall of the “Iron Curtain”, and a search for alternative moral frameworks in the period, often characterized as “postmodern” and/or “postsocialist” – the 1980s and the 1990s.},

  abstract = {This article analyzes the concept of postcolonial aesthetics as developed and debated by such critics as Bill Ashcroft, Elleke Boehmer and Robert Young. In particular, it critiques Ashcroft’s theorization of the postcolonial aesthetics in his article ‘Towards a Postcolonial Aesthetics’ and recommends an alternative approach to the conceptualization of postcolonial aesthetics with reference to Muhammad Hasan Askari’s essay on Ahmed Ali’s novel Twilight in Delhi. It questions Ashcroft’s emphasis on the hybrid linguistic makeup of the postcolonial text as the source of the particular aesthetic effects of the text and emphasizes the need for differentiating between affection– the writer’s deep sense of engagement with and involvement in the narrative – and affectation – a clever use of native words and expressions by the writer to authenticate his or her cultural identity – in discussing the affective dimension of a postcolonial text. The article argues that the aesthetic impact of the postcolonial text is produced by the intensity of experience and emotional involvement of the postcolonial writer (affection) as opposed to being produced by creative wordplay and mixing of local and foreign languages (affectation). Thus, the article contributes to the ongoing debates about the aesthetic dimension of postcolonial literature.},

  abstract = {Появление нового — это вопрос, который всегда имел чрезвычайную важность для социальной философии. Для того, чтобы уловить его в своем единстве, нам стоит посмотреть на него в состоянии раскола. В рамках этой статьи я постараюсь через сравнение онтологических концепций Эрнста Блоха и Алена Бадью показать все то общее, что есть у двух таких разных способов производства нового, как утопия и событие. В философиях Блоха и Бадью легко обнаружить много общих черт, а именно вопросы: ставки на субъекта; онтологической имманентизации трансцендентного; противостояния коммунизма и фашизма; разрыва и единства. Несмотря на всю схожесть, есть и существенная разница, которая проходит по вопросу онтологической обращенности к новому. Через сравнение важных для этой темы аспектов систем двух авторов будет раскрыта та структура, которая позволяет говорить об общности их проекта, не элиминируя различия.},

  abstract = {The paper is, formally, a fragment of the soon-to-be-published book Forms of Reality. But in fact, it is an introduction to the author study into the fundamental theme of anthropology of form. First, it considers a form as an appearance— the image of phenomena. The author briefly describes the significance of the so-understood form for the existence of animals and people, human communities. And second, it is precisely anthropology of the form that is at the centre of the analysis: the form, its phenomenality and organization, differentiated integrity as derivatives from the interaction of consciousness with objects, a kind of its synthesizing ordering projection on the external reality. The paper preliminary examines the most essential, in the author’s view, anthropological foundations of the formal plan of reality that is opening up to people and, at the same time, is being generated with the involvement of their consciousness. The concept of reality, along with form, is the second key concept of the paper. The concept forwarded in the article rests on the philosophical and anthropological ideas of several philosophers (I. Kant, J. Bataille, M. Heidegger, J. Deleuze and F. Guattari, and especially E. Souriau), present-day natural science concepts, and, especially, the experience of art and the reflection of artists (F. Pessoa, Renaissance painters, C.D. Friedrich, E. Degas). For the author, the work of art and the relationship of consciousness with it act as a typological model of anthropology of the form. The paper analyzes the most significant factors and aspects of form and the resulting reality. It is the existential context of the subject-object relationship; their immediate and pre-unconscious nature. It is a visual distance in its dynamics and gestaltazation; it is a generation of meaning as morphogenesis of form. Distinguishing, following D. Lapoujade, between existence and reality, the author relies on E. Souriau’s concept of different modes of reality, in which the term l’instauration takes on the key meaning: the establishment as the self-affirmation of reality, equal to the birth of form at the intersection of human subjectivity and independent in-being (works of art). The reality, in the end, is the result of the constitution through a system of forms that is complex in its metamorphosis, in which “immanence” — preand beyond-subjective consciousness, a transcendental field that precedes concrete consciousness — occupies an important place. The author shows the complex (paradoxical, heterogeneous and, at the same time, unified/holistic) nature of so-understood forms of reality on the example of the evolution and dialectics of perspective in painting and through the analysis of C.D. Friedrich’s paintings.},

These films encompass the ethnographers’ knowledge of the reconstructed period, the beginning of the 20th century. Nonetheless, the films made in Udmurtia contain several shots that reflect skills and practices still active at the end of that century. Other films are totally shot spontaneously, and there is also an example of comparative material. These forgotten films deserve to be remembered.},

Der Beitrag konzentriert sich auf eine bestimmte Kampagne, die der „Cinefizierung“ in der Kultur Lettlands während der stalinistischen Jahre, und zeigt an, wie die Sowjetisierung im Bereich Kultur die Strategien der westlichen kulturellen Kolonisierung widerspiegelt. Es werden drei „Schlaglichter“ aus der Geschichte der Cinefizierung präsentiert: die Politik des Einsatzes eines Kinorepertoires, die der sowjetischen Indoktrination diente; die sowjetisch-lettische Filmproduktion, die die Besatzung rechtfertigte; und die Einführung von Schlüsselpersonen, die als Handlanger Moskaus fungierten. Die Verfasser der Studie kommen zu dem Schluss, dass der Prozess der Cinefizierung in Lettland nur teilweise und nur temporär in der Umsetzung seiner propagandistischen Ziele erfolgreich verlief. Die „traditionellen“ Kolonisierungsstrategien, die die sowjetischen Besatzer anwandten, waren auf einen unabhängigen Nationalstaat, wie es Lettland vor der sowjetischen Besatzung war, nicht anwendbar.},

However, it is known only by a reproduction printed in a Russian art magazine Аполлон [Apollon]1, with a title Conte fantastique and Сказка [Fairy Tale] and Stravinsky was specified as an owner of the painting and other details have not been well-researched. Even though some researchers visited St. Petersburg to find the painting several years ago, yet no trace was ever found.

This might be thought of in terms of Derrida’s distinction between ‘polysemy’ and ‘dissemination’, in so far as any concept of translation will ‘re-mark’ a translation or reception of something like khora, the ‘all-receiving’. This means both that khora is untranslatable and that its translation into every language is inevitable, which has implications for the question of a ‘politics of khora’, as becomes particularly apparent in Derrida’s unpublished seminar from 1985–86.},

  abstract = {The paper deals with the literature of the Soviet Estonia that was a very ambivalent phenomenon. It suffered considerably in the forties and fifties by the direct assault repressions. Banning the publishing of the exile authors destroyed the continuity of the literature and spoiled the best creative years of many writers who had stayed homeland. In the early sixties a new generation came into the Estonian literature, by today they have become the living classics (Hando Runnel, Paul-Erik Rummo, Mats Traat, Arvo Valton, Jaan Kaplinski, Viivi Luik, Juhan Viiding etc.). The doctrine of “the flourishing culture” was included in the Soviet doctrine, so the authorities had to bear the writers, though they tried to control and direct them permanently. Though the pressure of the regime eased in the sixties, the censorship and the party’s guidance still endured. This was the reason why there were no memoirists or essayists, why many authors have some confusing texts among their early works, why the tradition of the Estonian literature is fragmentary. In the last decades of the occupation the creative unions were in opposition rather than in collaboration with the establishment.},

  abstract = {This article is focused on the work of Genrikh Sapgir, an outstanding Russian poet of the late twentieth century. It examines the evolution of his poetics, considered in relation to narrative subjectivity and its mutability in his poems. As a young poet, Sapgir openly announced his rejection of a strong authorial position in the text, effectively turning the author into a “function,” merely relaying “alien” voices without changing them significantly (as can be observed in his book, Voices). However, since the late 1980s, the poet began to move towards a more pronounced subjectivity. Eventually, he reneged on his earlier convictions and returned to a position where the author becomes the single omnipotent subject of the poetic utterance. However, this evolution was far from linear, and reveals a number of deviations and various hybrid forms. For instance, Sapgir’s book, Pushkin’s Notebooks, features a double subject, whereas his Monologues are concerned with mutable subjectivity. In turn, his book, Tactile Instruments, rejects the principle of “lyrical narration” altogether, calling its readers to concrete action by means of verbal address. This effectively divides the subject into two hypostases – one that speaks and another that acts.},

  abstract = {This article discusses the tension between the temporality of progress, characteristic of the modern time regime and totalitarian politics of time, and the nature of traumatic memory, as they are embedded in Nora Ikstena’s novel Soviet Milk (2015). Ikstena’s widely translated work is particularly informative in this aspect because it offers a detailed and self-reflexively narrated account of living during the Soviet occupation of Latvia, illuminating the way individual memory of troubling past events clashed with sociopolitical frameworks that endorsed the forgetting of its own victims. In my reading of this novel, I draw on relatively recent studies of experience of time and trauma that have shifted from the unspeakability of trauma to its cultural contexts and narrative possibilities by giving a realistic depiction of suffering and its aftermath. Ultimately, I turn to the question of the ethics of form to show how Ikstena employs the temporality of progress to enhance our understanding of specific historical others, covering also the tie between persistent or structural traumatization and melancholia.},

Soviet pedagogues perceived this literature as a tool for training “literate spectators,” able to discern social and political importance of images. The article follows this idea, using the books for tracing visual regimes that represented class and ethnicity in the 1920s–1930s. Picture books for children successfully reflected the dual nature of socialist transformations in the USSR, where building new sites of industrial production were closely linked with the building of new nations. Very early on, this literature also documented the bifurcation of this dual process. The detailed portrayal of ethnic distinctions was paralleled by the visual disappearance of the working class, producing a stream of illustrations in which technology and ethnic groups emerged as self-sufficient visual fields, ostensibly disconnected from class, labor, and history.},

The mnemonic practices of the ethnic minorities are shown to differ from the public narratives (both Russian and Estonian), thereby showing heterogeneity in the memories of the Soviet past.

How Difficult it is to Love by Jerzy Szczygieł (1976) tells the story of a young blind man who, after living many years “unproductively” with his mother, decides to study and work. Published in 1986, Klementyna Sołonowicz-Olbrychska’s novel The Meetings also focuses on a blind male teenager who leaves his hometown to live with other blind students at a residential school where he plans a future profession. The two works are concerned with the processes of becoming disabled and becoming a part of the blind community. Crucially, it is productivity – the main value in a socialist state – that participates in the formation of disability identity and enables disabled men to form separate communities and workshops for disabled people.},

  abstract = {This essay examines the entangling of the poetic and the ethnographic in the art cinema of the 1960s as an indicator of a broader collision of epistemological/discursive regimes in postwar Soviet cinema—and ultimately, a clash between two fundamentally opposed approaches to the discursive production of history. In the Soviet poetic cinema of the 1960s, the temporal-spatial frameworks of the Stalin era are disrupted, shifting first of all, to what Tarkovsky called a lived experience of time—that is, to the subjective emotions and experiences of individual people; second, to localized histories that may not coincide with the supra-national Soviet developmental narrative; and third, to the positing of an archaic, even pre-historical temporality as a kind of lost ideal. I argue that poetic cinema serves as a site for playing out the contradiction among temporalities and spatialities in post-Stalin culture, and therefore among opposed sense-making projects and representational modes, creating the possibility for subverting the colonial function of Soviet cinema.},

  abstract = {Rannamaa’s youth novel duology Kadri (1959) and Stepmother (1963), set from mid1950s to 1961, has retained its appeal across generations in Estonia. This article discusses the novels as a postcolonial Bildungsroman, analyzing the tangle of diver­ gent and often contradictory strands inflecting the socio-political, cultural, and literary phenomena and interconnections operative at the time of their writing. The example of the Kadri novels and their history of publication will show how a particular locus of entanglement need not be static, but rather one transforming in time, and, crucially, one producing propulsions to untangle combined with the dynamics of entanglement and relationality.},

At North American universities and colleges, faculty have conducted forums to help students understand how this senseless war came about. Enrolment in Russian language courses is down, while interest in Polish and Ukrainian is on the rise. Russian literature and cultural history are imbued with an imperial and colonial tradition that the author seeks to decolonize in his teaching. Aleksandr Pushkin was in favour of conquering the Caucasus, while Nikolai Gogol′, a colonial outsider, negotiated his place in the empire. Russian and Western histories pay little attention to Ukraine, and that needs correction. Kyivan Rus needs to be treated as a state in its own right. Reconciliation between Russia and Ukraine will have to be based on Russia’s recognition of Ukraine as a separate and independent state. Russian studies need to be decolonized, and, following Canada’s lead, US institutions should develop Ukrainian studies.},

In the course of his career, which spanned nearly 50 years, Streičs made films that were popular in Latvia, as well as throughout the Soviet Union. He is one of the few Latvian film directors who managed to continue a comparatively stable career in the newly reindependent Republic of Latvia. Streičs skilfully used the canonised means of expression of classical cinema and superficially fulfilled the demands of socialist realism to provide appealing and life-asserting narratives for the audiences. Being a full-time film director at Riga Film Studio, and gradually becoming a master of the studio system, Jānis Streičs managed to subordinate the system to his own needs, outgrowing it and becoming an auteur with an idiosyncratic style and consistently developed topics.1 The most expressive elements of his visual style can be found in his war films, which are presented as women’s reflections on war.},

С этой целью автор предлагает отказаться мыслить образ как художественный, иными словами, как обусловленный чем-то трансцендентным, например, непреходящими законами красоты. Опыт авангардного искусства ХХ в. указывает иные возможности, когда под вопрос ставится не только автономия искусства, но и его художественная и эстетическая самодостаточность. Предтечей авангардного искусства в этом смысле выступает икона. Феноменологическая интерпретация иконы помогает понять, чтó значит образ как оператор трансформаций. Так понимаемый образ противостоит изображению, демонстрируя свой действенный и динамический характер: речь, в частности, идет о векторах, направляющих и меняющих зрительский взгляд. Физическое (нехудожественное) понимание образа восходит к физикалистской философии XVII в. Так, у Спинозы образ есть не что иное, как отпечаток телесных воздействий. Эти воздействия множественны и гетерогенны. Ухватить их можно с помощью понятия динамического знака, который остается верным физике самих вещей. Эти же связи по-своему проявляет и современное акционистское искусство, являясь искусством действия в точном смысле слова.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Tourism is a crucial arena for the production, circulation, and negotiation of knowledge about the past. However, the existing literature on memory and tourism often provides limited insights into the processes and specific forms of memory production in tourism and its political significance. Incorporating scholarship from different fields, including writings in the fields of memory, heritage, and tourism studies, this chapter provides a critical discussion of limitations in existing work on the tourism-memory nexus and outlines how a conceptualisation of tourism as memory-making helps to overcome these. This conceptualisation is based on four premises: (1) an emphasis on memory-making as a process done by different actors; (2) a transnational approach that situates memory-making in a wider political context; (3) a consideration of the diverse cultural forms that memory-making takes, including an understanding of how they are shaped, but not determined, by commodification processes; and (4) an approach that sees memory as generative for social and (geo)political relations.},

In this article, I explore the gravitation toward this and other short and documentary genres. I foreground the subject of literary form, which has, I maintain, for too long remained in the background of scholarship on Soviet literature. The rise of a new privileged form was related dialogically to the emergence of a new normative subjectivity–one that called on citizens to engage in meticulous empirical investigations of Soviet life and to arrive at and advance their own critical conclusions about Soviet reality. In advancing these arguments, I revise the interpretations of Soviet literary history that have highlighted the significance of the novel, contributing to a growing body of scholarship on the history of Soviet subjectivity.},

Typically, analyses of these conflicts examine contradictions between opposed accounts, critique distortions of the histor­ ical record, and attempt to establish corrected narratives. Instead, the present article examines how seemingly incommensurate accounts may be elements of larger struc­ tures of entangled mutual reinforcement. Analysis is directed toward Latvian and Russian documentary film accounts of World War II, and reveals how alternate regimes of truth may operate not to destabilize one another, but rather to reinforce opposition and to support symmetrical occlusions in memory discourse.},

The article also considers Derrida’s reading of Kafka in ‘‘Before the Law,’’ decisive for his analysis of the problematics in question and for our understanding of the relationships between ‘‘geometry and democracy.’’ These relationships, the article argues, are an essential concern of much of Derrida’s work and of our culture, from the pre-Socratics on.},

The phenomenon was prevalent in the mass culture until the end of the Soviet era. Following occupation by the USSR in 1940, in order to build a bridge between Soviet and national identity, the Soviet Lithuanian administration promoted song festivals as emotional events to generate a hybrid synthesis of the Soviet ideas and the national elements. Based on both the national tradition and Soviet cultural policies, these events helped blend the national and the Soviet experiences.},

  abstract = {What is the meaning of perestrojka? There is no doubt that it led to the end of the Cold War and had a huge impact on the international situation. Nevertheless, there is no consensus as to the outcomes of perestrojka. Perestrojka brought about the collapse of the Soviet Union. This fact might be interpreted positively: it opened the possibility to restore historical truth and to create independent democratic states. From another perspective, it can be conceived negatively as a destruction of the integrity of the Soviet Union and the loss of a part of the territory as well as the economy of Russia (according to the President of the Gorbacˇev Foundation, Viktor Kuvaldin, during the conference ‘‘Revisiting Perestroika—Processes and Alternatives’’). Perestrojka has no one definite general meaning, but it has a very specific one for Lithuania. In this paper I ask: What is the meaning of perestrojka for contemporary Lithuania and for post-Soviet life? Was perestrojka a failure or a success? I approach perestrojka from a moral point of view, suggesting that the perestrojka made possible a fundamental choice between several alternatives. Once the choice was made the specificity of future goals and evaluation of the past opened up. I concentrate on the moral value of the act of accommodation (and resistance) to the Soviet regime, on the conflict of values represented by the ‘‘nation’s own’’ and the goodness of the political order, and on the role of freedom and determinism in history. Immanuel Kant’s conception of duty and the categorical imperative is used as a model for the analysis of the situation of choice.},

It claims that the politics of secularization was led primarily by political pragmatics in order to build a society of loyal Soviet citizens rather than by the dogmatically declared claim of creating a society of atheists with strong materialist views. The article focuses on political measures to develop a non-religious worldview (or ethics) in Soviet Lithuania in the 1960–1980s: the authority’s motivation to promote secular ethics, the efforts to institutionalize the ethical search, and the acknowledged failures in satisfying the needs of the society. It shows that by the end of the 1980s, atheisation policies had resulted in a plurality of secular worldviews: ideological as well as religious indifference, secular humanism, New-Age like spiritualism, and even neo-paganism.},

Concretely, I will argue that Rancière’s aesthetic understanding can be viewed as a torsion of a body that affects its vital arrangements, which thereby open paths for political emancipation. I will support my claim with Rancière’s reading of the plebeian philosopher Gauny, as well as works that have not been sufficiently considered in secondary literature, such as The Nights of Labor and The Ignorant Schoolmaster. My reading will, I maintain, help to question common interpretations of emancipation in Rancière that tend to read this notion either in dichotomous terms or as a merely ephemeral, evental practice with no concrete conditions of possibility and without long-lasting or verifiable effects in the world.},

  abstract = {Documentary cinema is intimately tied to historical memory. Not only does it seek to reconstruct historical narrative, but it often functions as an historical document itself. Moreover, the connection between the rhetoric of documentary film and historical truth pushes the documentary into overtly political alignments which influence its audience. This essay describes and dissects the history and rhetoric of documentary cinema, tracing its various modes of address from the earliest moments of cinematic representation through its uses for ethnographers, artists, governments, and marginal political organizations in the present. The different uses of documentary result in a wide variety of formal strategies to persuade the audience of a film's truth. These strategies are based on a desire to enlist the audience in the process of historical reconstruction. The documentary film differentiates itself from narrative cinema by claiming its status as a truth-telling mode. However, as a filmic construction, it relies on cinematic semiosis to convince its audience of its validity and truth. By looking at the history of documentary address, this essay outlines the rhetoric of persuasion and evaluates its effectiveness. The documentary calls upon its audience to participate in historical remembering by presenting an intimate view of reality. Through cinematic devices such as montage, voice-over, intertitles, and long takes, documentary provokes its audience to new understandings about social, economic, political, and cultural differences and struggles. The films actively engage with their world; however, often viewers respond to the same devices motivating classic Hollywood narratives. Thus the genre reinforces dominant patterns of vision. Recent challenges to the emotional manipulations of documentary deconstruct its forms and conventions so that the films interrogate not only historical memory but their own investment in its recreation. Imaginative documentaries, such as Claude Lanzmann's Shoah, foreground their partial and contingent qualities, pushing viewers to question cinematic representation and its place in historical memory. Moreover, they ask audiences to think about their place in the films' meanings as well as their responsibility to the past and its interpretations.},

But aesthetics is not a discourse. It is an historical regime for the identification of art. This regime is paradoxical, because it founds the autonomy of art only at the price of suppressing the boundaries separating its practices and its objects from those of everyday life and of making free aesthetic play into the promise of a new revolution. Aesthetics is not a politics by accident but in essence. But this politics operates in the unresolved tension between two opposed forms of politics: the first consists in transforming art into forms of collective life, the second in preserving from all forms of militant or commercial compromise the autonomy that makes it a promise of emancipation. This constitutive tension sheds light on the paradoxes and transformations of critical art. It also makes it possible to understand why today's calls to free art from aesthetics are misguided and lead to a smothering of both aesthetics and politics in ethics},

This question, however, can be turned around: is there something in being an exophonic poet that, rather than being an obstacle, could make the development and maturing of a poetic language possible? Adam Zagajewski writes that ardor, not irony, can be primary building blocks, and about the ideal of being ‘in between’. Ben Lerner writes about the sources of Hatred of Poetry and sees poetry as a potential that can never be completely realised. Being between languages causes the reality of language as one of many possibilities to be always present. The result can be construed as a poetic of time and light, but also of a reconciliation at depth warranted by the poetic ethos. Language becomes aware of itself, its autonomy and inherent lack of objectivity, and this becomes less naive and prone to cliches, but this awareness need not spiral into self-dissolving irony. Rather, it may seek to reconcile the possible ways of seeing the world into a new sense of sincerity. It inspires creative and playful use of language, gives heightened awareness of possible metaphors even where the sense of the transferred image is absent within the framework of one language. This has the potential to change perception of language and reality in a way that makes poetry almost possible.},

  abstract = {In this article a historical overview of the linguistic policy of the Soviet Union is given. Attention is paid to the ideological goals influencing linguistic policy, their realisation and the results. Though the linguistic policy of the USSR is an implicit phenomenon, 3 main periods may be observed, differing in the methods used for achieving ideological goals. These were preceded by an indistinct period without a unified complex of means, due to the struggle for power in the leadership of the USSR. The first period during the Stalin regime may be characterised by urgent and violent measures taken to bring Communist ideals to life by eliminating whole ethnic groups according to the class-based approach. During the second period—postStalinism—less violence was used, while the main emphasis was laid on rebuilding human nature and eliminating signs of ethnic origin. A special type of education was worked out called international education; for extreme cases psychiatric hospitals and prisons were used. This period, now called 'stagnation', was mainly connected with the name of Brezhnev. The third period began when Gorbachev came to power. To get out of the impasse 'perestroika' was introduced. Nevertheless, the ideal of the USSR, the Communist empire, was maintained, though Glasnost was allowed.},

  abstract = {The purpose of the essay is to contextualize and explain the philosophical project that is under way in Jacques Derrida’s Kh ¯ora of 1993. Upon a cursory reading, the book will appear to be merely the unpacking of yet another undecidable term that Derrida has located within the history of metaphysics. But, in fact, the stakes of this text are much higher in that Derrida’s aim is to continue developing a project that was announced in the late 1960s, namely, to deregionalize ontology. Precisely what Derrida meant by that phrase and the various texts one would have to revisit in order to properly understand how Kh ¯ora instrumentalizes deregionalization is what this essay attempts to survey. Lastly, as Husserlian phenomenology is quite central to the concerns of this essay, researchers may consider it as a contribution to the study of Derrida’s relation to Husserl’s philosophy. Major texts by Derrida that are discussed include The Problem of Genesis in Husserlian Phenomenology, ‘La difference’, Voice and Phenomena, Of Grammatology, ‘Plato’s Pharmacy’, ‘How to Avoid Speaking: Denials’, and Khora. Major topics include: the transcendental ego, regional phenomenology, voice and writing, differance, origin, genesis, woman, negative theology, khora, and Plato.},

This essay examines a series of tensions and contradictions: between mobilisation and dwelling; between the chiliasm of the official ideology of communism and the process of settling and making home in these new single‐family flats; between mass‐produced structures and the agency of the individual; and between the prescriptions of the state's agents and the practices of ordinary amateur homemakers, primarily women. Drawing on contemporary press and archival sources, as well as on interviews with women who moved into the newly‐built apartments, the article analyses the ways in which, in authoritative discourse and in everyday practice, specialists and amateurs, primarily female homemakers, sought to transcend the antithesis of home comfort and communism.},

By paying attention to the different social contacts of the historical actors and how they construct an epistemic community, the “constructiveness” of the film canon as socially and historically situated knowledge comes to the forefront.},

Focusing on the period 1990-2015, Nelly Richard denounces the politics and aesthetics of forgetting that have underpinned both the protracted transition out of dictatorship and the denial of justice to its survivors and victims. What are the perils and social costs of a culture of forgetting' What forms do memories of injustice take in newly formed democracies' How might a history of violence and an ethics of reparation be reconciled in post-autocratic societies' In addressing these and other questions, Richard exposes the abuses of the past and the present while also attending to the residues of memory that are manifested in street protests, literature, and the media, and in artistic practices from architecture and urban design to installation and film. While cultural artifacts can be powerful devices for resistance and critique, Richard argues that they can also be complicit in reproducing and collaborating with forms of institutional and political oblivion. Both within Chile and beyond, Richard offers a trenchant critique of how authoritarian regimes and neoliberal states whittle away at memory's critical capacity. At a time of seismic political realignments in Latin America and internationally, Eruptions of Memory makes a powerful case for the ethical, political, and aesthetic value of memory."--Provided by publisher},

  abstract = {The 1950s and 60s in European film history is considered to be modernist period that was most explicitly manifested in the cinema of West European countries (France, Italy and others). Fragmentation of the narrative, loosening of linkage between events, innovative approaches in editing, foregrounding of subjectivity are only some of formal techniques characterizing the modernist aesthetics in cinema. In the soviet period of Latvian film history there are merely a few films in which one can identify modernist features. Basically, those are films by Rolands Kalniņš and in particular his feature film “Four White Shirts” (1967). By its form this film is very unusual in the context of Latvian film history and it resonated with the dominant trends in West European cinema in the 1950s and 60s. “Four White Shirts”, as well as several other films by Rolands Kalniņš, like “Stone and Flinders” (Akmens un šķembas, 1966), and “Maritime Climate” (Piejūras klimats, 1974) were banned by censorship and never got to cinema screens and were practically “erased”, eliminated from the Latvian cinema processes. The present research will be an analysis of the aesthetics of Rolands Kalniņš’ film “Four White Shirts” (1967) focusing on those elements in the film that are typical for European modernist cinema. The return of the film “Four White Shirts” to the world cinema context took place half a century after it was made – its restored print was included in Cannes Film Festival programme Cannes Classics in 2018. The international premier of the film in 2018 enabled it to become the most renowned Latvian fiction film in Western Europe by revealing the internationally practically unknown modernist period of Latvian cinema in the 1960s that culminated in Rolands Kalniņš’ film “Four White Shirts”. The destiny of this film, the ban to screen it publicly affirms the fact that modernist aesthetics was considered to be unacceptable within the context of the soviet culture.},

  abstract = {This article examines the processes of de-Sovietization of public spaces in Lithuania, focusing on the visual transformation of monuments after the collapse of the Soviet Union. While scholarship has primarily analyzed the dismantling of Soviet monuments as acts of iconoclasm, this study argues that de-Sovietization is a dual process involving both negative and positive dimensions: the removal of Soviet-era symbols and the creation of new monuments that articulate a post-Soviet national narrative. Drawing on Jacques Rancière’s framework of artistic regimes, the article explores how newly constructed or restored monuments embody the search for a new symbolic language of political and social communication. The analysis is based on qualitative content analysis of expert interviews with sculptors, architects, and artists involved in monument-making in Lithuania since 1990. Over the past three decades, more than 400 monuments have been erected in Lithuania, reflecting the tensions between continuity and rupture with Soviet monumentalism. While naturalistic monuments often avoided controversy, projects departing from realistic aesthetics—such as Regimantas Midvikis’ Exploded Bunker and Andrius Labašauskas’ Freedom Hill—became sites of conflict and public debate. By identifying the visual features of positive de-Sovietization, the article contributes to understanding how post-Soviet societies negotiate historical memory, identity, and aesthetic form in public space.},

  abstract = {Central among recent changes in the Soviet Union is an expanding and increasingly public politics of federalism. The Soviet developmental strategy assigned federalism and the cadres of national-territorial administration a central role in its response to the “nationalities question.” This strategy offers a key to three questions about the rise of assertive ethnofederalism over the past three decades: Why have federal institutions that provided interethnic peace during the transition to industrialization become vehicles of protest in recent years? Why have relatively advantaged ethnic groups been most assertive, whereas groups near the lower end of most comparative measures of socioeconomic and political success have been relatively quiescent? Why have major public demands—and the most important issues of contention between center and periphery—focused to such a large degree upon the details of the Soviet developmental strategy and upon federalism in particular},

  abstract = {Artiklis vaatlen olmekirjanduse nimelist nähtust – 1970. ja 1980. aastate vahetusel Nõukogude Eestis ilmunud romaane, mille keskseks teemaks olid kaasaegsed sugudevahelised suhted. Asetan olmekirjanduse kitsalt eesti kirjanduspildist laiemale, üleliidulisele taustale, mida kujundavad paljuski sotsioloogia areng ning selle keskajakirjanduslik kajastus. Muuhulgas sõna emantsipatsioon kasutuse kaudu teostes näitan romaanide käsitluslaadi vastavust kaasaegsele ajakirjanduslikule käsitluslaadile. Seeläbi paigutan romaanid ajakirjandusega ühte, „hilisnõukogude liberaalsesse kriitilisse diskursusse“, kus võim ja vastupanu, nõukogulikkus ja ebanõukogulikkus on tihedasti läbi põimunud.~In this article, I examine a phenomenon known as 'everyday literature' (olmekirjandus)—novels published in Soviet Estonia at the turn of the 1970s—1980s. By name, these novels could be expected to depict contemporary everyday life, whereas they really focus on gender relations, marital and especially extramarital relationships. Contemporary criticism did not value such books highly; nevertheless, they stood out as a corpus and succeeded in evoking a discussion. In retrospect, everyday novels have been interpreted as a particular incarnation of light/lowbrow literature, as timid harbingers of postmodernism, and as proto-feminist works. While these interpretations all have their grounds, they operate in a narrower context of Estonian (national) literature. In this article, I set everyday novels on a wider background of the cultural situation in the contemporary Soviet Union.This situation was heavily influenced by the rebirth of sociology and its reflections in print media. Having been banned meanwhile since the middle of the 1950s, sociology again became a permitted discipline in the Soviet Union. Among prominent areas of study were matters concerning the private sphere: family life and gender dynamics. That in turn gave rise to an extensive discussion of gender relations and “the woman question” in contemporary print media—in newspapers, culture magazines and popular science magazines. The discourse was one of sharp antagonism, tending to ridicule the state-endorsed slogan of women’s emancipation and gender equality, and to pit men and women against one another.I argue that the vocabulary and the general approach of everyday novels closely corresponds to that of the print media, and acknowledging this allows for the most fruitful interpretation of these works. I demonstrate the close proximity of the novels to media accounts, describing the general problem settings of the novels and, more closely, the use of the very word 'emancipation' itself. Both novels and media texts feature the so-called emancipated woman and her (lacking) counterpart – either an irresponsible womanizer or a weak drunkard of a man. Neither male or female characters are content with the situation and while the blame may shift from one party to another, in novels as well as in media accounts, the phenomenon of emancipation itself is considered a negative, but most importantly, a ridiculous thing.The corpus seems to have awoken opposite intuitions already in its contemporary audience. As most often the case with the literature of the Soviet era, a question of conformism and resistance, of Sovietness and anti-Sovietness has implicitly coloured the discussions of everyday literature. On the one hand, the novels were considered petty, taking on subjects familiar from print media and offering no new depths in their approach. The latter was perhaps most clearly expressed in a 1980 piece by Rein Veidemann that gives its name to the current article, “On the nature, meaning, and function of everyday literature”;~ according to an exile Estonian reviewer’s ironic comment, everyday novels exemplified the truest socialist realism. On the other hand, they were read very widely and succeeded in stirring up a controversy, thus proving to be at least somewhat unconventional in the time and place of their publication. An evident reason are open references to sexual matters; however, it is not irrelevant that they touched upon the problems of changing gender relations, even if the analysis they offered did not satisfy the audience.In addition to sketching out the general power relations of Soviet Russia and Soviet Estonia, and pointing out the influence of the central Soviet print media on Estonian culture, the framework of postcolonial studies emphasizes that Sovietness and anti-Sovietness does not have to be an either/or question—those seemingly opposite intuitions may well thrive side by side. Drawing a parallel between the novels and media texts among other things allows them to be placed within the 'late Soviet liberal critical discourse', a term used to describe the metaphor-laden media discourse of the 1970s—1980s Soviet Union. This discourse is simultaneously a locus of conformism and resistance, avoiding certain taboo subjects and displaying fiercely critical attitudes toward other, more “harmless” subjects as a manner of managing the dissatisfaction of the Soviet citizen; whereas “the woman question” has been argued to be namely one of such token subjects. Positioning the novels within the late Soviet liberal critical discourse similarly on the one hand blocks the interpretation of the novels as something unprecedented and, no less, subversive and dissident or even implicitly nationalist; on the other hand, it does not completely cut off their critical potential.},

Although the image of Spartacus in Soviet historiography has been investigated by scholars, the process of acculturation and reception of his figure within toponymy, onomastics, sport, and history-writing has not been researched as a holistic approach of Soviet propaganda. This article traces how and why Spartacus’s image became the primary figure of the classical antiquity in Soviet propaganda of the 1920s. The article argues that it was not Soviet historiography in the 1920s that shaped his image to be embodied in the Soviet narratives and public space. Rather, art, local toponymy, and sports created and promoted a particularly Soviet reception of Spartacus in the 1920s and 1930s which provided implications for socialist Central-Eastern European countries in the post-World War II era.},

The excerpts from archival texts, published here for the first time, reveal the organisational and technical, as well as the creative and artistic conditions of sound design in Soviet Russian cinema in the specified period, and explain the context in which the idea of the establishment of a sound department at VGIK emerged and how it was implemented.},

An initial idiom of postcolonial studies is revisited in order to complement their dominant scope in the Baltics, focused primarily on a retrospective cultural study of Baltic/Soviet relationships. The argument elaborates on the urgency of the expanding research agenda regarding the Baltic/European research framework. By pointing out the frequent occurrence of the superiority or inferiority value scale in cross-cultural references sampled from press releases of the Art Museum of Estonia, the article concludes that mainstream cultural self-reflection in Estonia is nowadays subjected to the supremacy of the imagined West European viewpoint.},

Firstly, the article previews the structural factors conducive to network formation. Secondly, it examines the networks by highlighting cross-national differences.

The organisers of the conference intended to describe, analyse and explain the state policies and activities used in Eastern Europe for shaping the Communist identity and personality by means of manipulating the historical consciousness, and the efficiency of those policies and activities, proceeding from the official historical approaches of the former Eastern bloc. Ideologically mutated history was the important component of the official, Communist identity. The artificial official history and the new historical identity it forced upon the population aspired to establish the sole possible truth by means of half-truths. Probably the most important thread that comes through every article in this collection is the conflict between the official, communist identity and the nation's historical memory, and its consequences},

The focus is on the Ramuva movement, founded in 1970 at Vilnius University and continuing until 1994. The activities of the Lithuanian regional studies movement were characterised by diverse education and ethnographic practices. I assert that the key to the success of Ramuva’s activity was a creative circumventing of Soviet ideology and practice. Through a discussion of theoretical issues and the results of fieldwork, I analyse the following questions: How did Marxism–Leninism change ethnography in Soviet Lithuania? What were the activities, methods and theory of regional research? Was Ramuva’s policy of knowledge production in opposition to the Soviet regime?},

This article reconstructs the emergence of this genre in the context of Soviet post-revolutionary euphoria for the scientific transformation of society and the avant-gardist experimental laboratories of dreams. The writer M. Il’in, nowadays mostly forgotten, was the most widely published author and main advocate of this new kind of science writing at the time. In the 1930s, M. Il’in adopted many of the devices and claims of prominent avant-garde artists such as Sergei Tret’iakov and appropriated them for his totalizing and globalizing approach to representation. In unpacking M. Il’in’s prose, this article explores the complex and ambiguous formation of Socialist Realism in the field of popular scientific literature.},

We all realized that this would be a momentous occasion, a memorial to the fate that the Nazi-Soviet pact had forced on Lithuania. A secret protocol to that pact had divided up Eastern Europe between the two parties "in the event of territorial and political rearrangement"; a week later, on September 1, 1939, German troops invaded Poland.

It focuses on the effects the 1989 electoral campaign for the USSR Congress of People’s Deputies had on their evolution. The ecological issue had stirred people into action and had been more and more present on the political agenda since 1986. However it almost vanished as a significant political stake and as a nascent grassroots movement in these first contested elections, at least in Moscow. The very configuration of political interplay during this campaign incited the informal clubs and the “radical” CPSU reformers they were supporting to relegate to the background the ecological issue. Henceforth, ecological groups were confined in the margins of the political space.},

Bien qu’utilisée dans un autre contexte, la notion de dispositif chez Foucault a elle aussi de fortes connotations techniques, évoquant les aspects techniques du pouvoir d’un côté et décrivant la technique comme intrinsèquement liée au phénomène du pouvoir de l’autre côté. En prenant pour exemple l’appareil photographique, nous essayons de montrer que la notion d’appareil donne la possibilité d’établir une autre hiérarchie de la technique et du pouvoir. À la difference du dispositif, le concept d’appareil permet non seulement de penser la rationalité technique comme irréductible à celle du pouvoir, mais aussi d’accentuer la primauté du conditionnement technique par rapport à tous les autres, y compris le conditionnement par le pouvoir. En outre, la notion d’appareil peut servir de base pour une nouvelle herméneutique historique de la technique, qui diffère des modèles qu’on trouve chez Heidegger et Simondon.},

  abstract = {Nikita Khrushchev's proposal to give parents of non-Russian children the choice of whether to send their children to a school with education in their own tongue, or to a Russian school, was first advanced at the end of 1958. It immediately provoked a furious response from leaders of the non-Russian republics of the multi-national Soviet Union, and was an issue contributing to political purges in Azerbaijan and Latvia in 1959. In this article, Jeremy Smith uses documents from archives in four Soviet republics to analyze the responses from the republics. Smith shows that republic leaders were mostly agreed on an alternative solution to the question of language of instruction, and pursued different strategies both to oppose the introduction of the reform and to obstruct its implementation once it was passed. The episode also underlines the uncertainty involved in center-periphery relations in the USSR.},

  abstract = {Red Nations offers an illuminating and informative overview of how the non-Russian republics of the Soviet Union experienced communist rule. It surveys the series of historical events that contributed to the break-up of the Soviet Union and evaluates their continuing resonance across post-soviet states today. Drawing from the latest research, Professor Smith offers comprehensive coverage of the revolutionary years, the early Soviet policies of developing nations, Stalin's purges and deportations of small nationalities, and the rise of independence movements. Through a single, unified narrative, this book illustrates how, in the post-Stalin period, many of the features of the modern nation state emerged. Both scholars and students will find this an indispensable contribution to the history of the dissolution of the USSR, the reconstruction of post-Soviet society, and its impact on non-Russian citizens from the years of the Russian Revolution through to the present day.},

  abstract = {In this paper I examine the interdependence of the late Soviet unofficial culture and the artist’s everyday communicative context, the underground scene, in which the individual and the social environment coalesce. The syntagmatically organized lifeworld of the Soviet underground was in contrast with the paradigm of state institutions that were structured in analogy with the party apparatus. Two axes of collective communication emerged, comparable to two different tropes: analogy and spatial proximity. Along this horizontal axis, the poetics and aesthetics of the unofficial literature and art can be traced back to the communicative and therefore systemic environment of the artists and authors. Much more than finished artifacts, their products were the result of an interactive process of creation within a very specific sociocultural domain, where shared sources, codes and aesthetics were combined with the possibility of direct influence. Many unofficial artifacts were born from the lively communication between writers and visual artists. In this context I discuss metonymy, intermediality and the phenomena of auto-reflexivity and metatextuality. My approach is situated between Boris Eikhenbaum’s sociology of literature, Iurii Tynianov’s cultural semiotics avant la letter, and Jürgen Habermas’ theory of communicative action.},

The book presents a range of perspectives on the effects of migration and of re-drawing of borders among groups and individuals for whom the Russian language has had an instrumental or symbolic prominence. How do recent geopolitical shifts impact on the policies and practices of newly independent states? How have communities and individuals come to redefine their own identities and core values? How does a cultural context in which the power relations between cultural and linguistic groups have been reversed or recalibrated affect the attitudes of each group? How does the potential for transnational identities impact on the interplay between diasporic and homeland communities? How does migration influence linguistic and parenting practices? This collection offers answers to these and many other questions through case studies from eleven regions in Europe, Central Asia and the Middle East.},

Случай Мамарда- швили отлично подходит для того, чтобы поставить эти патентован- ные дихотомии под вопрос. С одной стороны, он часто воспринима- ется как эталонная фигура, находя- щаяся в самом центре автономного субполя. С другой стороны, много- летняя работа в редакции «Вопро- сов философии», не дававшей упасть знамени марксизма, означает прак- тическое усвоение и использование советской ортодоксии. Передовицы рассматриваются как инструмент, использующийся одновременно для ритуального выражения лояльности, артикуляции корпоративного инте- реса и повышения ставок профессио- нальной игры.},

  abstract = {With great honour to readers of “Culture Crossroads” we are offering an essay by outstanding Lithuanian documentary film director Audrius Stonys (1966), in which he shares reflections on spatial and temporal changes in documentary films within the historical context by fixating cinematic turns in elements of mise-en-scène, especially in the landscape representation. The author is looking more closely at what is happening in the front and background of the documentary film “Ten Minutes Before the Flight of Icarus” (Dešimt minučių prieš Ikaro skrydį, 1990) directed by Arūnas Matelis (1961), a contemporary of Stonys. This particular film has been considered as a landmark which led to a shift towards a new era in Lithuanian documentary cinema.},

  abstract = {This article proposes a new perspective on avant-garde travel writing through the lens of scientific field work, investigating these new writing techniques in Boris Pil’niak’s expedition prose. In the 1920s, the researching writer represents a hidden, but influential counterpart to the widely propagated figure of the working writer. While the author as producer combines word and deed in an operative act, the author as researcher investigates the production of knowledge. This entails revising the centrality of facts. Literature as artistic research subverts factography by going beyond the horizons of veristic data registration to include uncharted realms and vague possibilities. This exploration leads to specific genres: the author as researcher tries his hand at a kind of laboratory text, a prolific genre at the intersection of testing equipment, recording media, and hypothetical thought. Not confined to a sterile lab, avant-garde writer-researchers, as members of research expeditions, oscillate between their home writing desks and the remote depths of the emerging USSR. At the same time, they explore writing practices situated between data acquisition, sampling, fact-finding, observation and recording.},

  abstract = {In the 1950s, amateur filmmaking had become a well-established feature of everyday life in the Soviets Union. However, in contrast to the state film industry, no centralized governmental body existed to control amateur filmmakers. As a result, state ideology was not always the primary motivation for making amateur films. The works that dared to experiment invariably emerged from the periphery, and the Latvian SSR became one of the citadels of the Soviet amateur film movement. Drawing upon the amateur film collection held at the Latvian State Archive of Audiovisual Documents, this paper will identify and analyse the various functions that amateur documentary filmmaking performed beyond its ostensible mission of transmitting Soviet ideology, and examine its role in creating alternative political, social, and cultural meanings, and prospects for national identity development and heritage preservation. It will primarily focus on the documentaries by Uldis Lapiņš, Zigurds Vidiņš, and Ingvars Leitis made in the 1970 and the 1980s, and look at how they used everyday matters – such as family, community, and travel –to express artistically as well as to address broader social and political issues of life in the post-war Soviet society.},

  abstract = {The article reviews the research of Baltic linguistics, including ancient writing, in Lithuania from the 1920s to the early 21st century. The aim was to discuss the development of some of the more important areas, directions and methods of Baltic linguistics, linking it with changes in public life and conjuncture, as well as national culture, and highlighting significant works. It begins with relatively modest but ambitious pre-war research conducted by traditional philological and comparative historical methods. It goes on to look at the oppressive time of the post-war ideological dictatorship, when, in principle, only activities of a practical nature were possible. The period of the so-called Thaw (ca. 1954–1965) allowed for some fresh air and maturing of the elite of Baltic language researchers, which in the years of stagnation (ca. 1965–1985) mastered the methods of internal reconstruction and structural linguistics, published significant works on the history of language, etymology, onomastics and synchronical linguistics, including theoretical ones, laid the foundations of schools of phonology and word formation. The review concludes with an epoch of Soviet transformation and restored independence (ca. 1985 to the present), which liberated researchers and gradually led to international horizons. Research in applied linguistics, terminology, stylistics, rhetoric and some other directions was discussed by collegues.           ,              Straipsnyje apžvelgiami baltų kalbotyros, apimant ir senąją raštiją, tyrimai Lietuvoje nuo XX~a. trečiojo dešimtmečio iki XXI~a. pradžios. Užsibrėžta aptarti svarbesnių baltų kalbotyros sričių, krypčių ir metodų raidą, siejant ją su visuomeninio gyvenimo, konjunktūros pokyčiais bei nacionaline kultūra ir iškeliant reikšmingus darbus. Pradedama nuo palyginti kuklių, bet ambicingų prieškario tyrimų, atliktų tradiciniais filologiniu ir lyginamuoju istoriniu metodais. Toliau žvelgiama į slogų pokarinės ideologinės diktatūros laiką, kada iš esmės buvo įmanoma tik praktinio pobūdžio veikla. Vadinamojo atšilimo laikotarpis (apie 1954–1965) leido įkvėpti gaivesnio oro, subrandinti baltistikos elitą, kuris sąstingio metais (apie 1965–1985) įvaldė vidinės rekonstrukcijos ir struktūrinės lingvistikos metodus, paskelbė reikšmingų kalbos istorijos, etimologijos, onomastikos ir sinchroninės kalbotyros veikalų, tarp jų ir teorinių, padėjo fonologijos ir žodžių darybos mokyklų pagrindus. Apžvalga baigiama sovietinės pertvarkos ir atkurtos nepriklausomybės epocha (apie 1986 iki dabar), išlaisvinusia tyrėjus ir pamažu išvedusia į tarptautinius horizontus. Taikomosios kalbotyros, terminologijos, stilistikos bei retorikos ir kai kurių kitų krypčių tyrimus šioje knygoje aptarė kolegos.},

Better gender balance in documentary-filmmaking noticeably increased the exposure to greater stylistic and thematic diversity, as well as paved the way for the new cinematic approaches to national and world history, politics, warfare, collective identity, and other issues traditionally assigned to men. This article examines creative documentaries directed by Giedrė Žickytė, Jūratė Samulionytė and Vilma Samulionytė, Martina Jablonskytė and Ramunė Rakauskaitė. First, it investigates how these films combine subjective, analytical, and critical approaches to examine and mediate complex phenomena in Lithuanian history. Second, it discusses how these women documentarists engage with the past and in what ways their approaches and languages differ from conventional historical documentaries.},

Hailed by filmmaker-critic Jonas Mekas as ‘one of the five most sexually transgressive films ever made,’ Pasportrets is a selfie avant la lettre and a prototypical sex tape important medium-specificity considerations aside though its greater historical significance may reside in the fact that it was essentially social media deprived of social circulation. It shares similarities, both in editing style and visual content, with certain films of the so-called American underground, Western European auteurs and various East European New Waves, although Pasportrets lacked their access to audiences. This predicament beset a cycle of contemporaneous, self-portrait works by members of Birojs (Office), a small collective of Latvian artists that included Grinbergs. Narrowly escaping confiscation by the Komitet gosudarstvennoy bezopasnosti (KGB) shortly after its completion, Pasportrets remained hidden until 1994 1995, when it was restored and premiered at Anthology Film Archives in New York City.},

  abstract = {This essay focuses on the problem of the decolonization of Crimea within the context of the ongoing Russia–Ukraine war. Both authors agree that the decolonization of Crimea involves a complex intellectual challenge for Ukrainian society and for the rest of the world. For centuries Crimea was a settler colony of the Russian Empire and the Soviet Union. In 2014, Russia resumed its settler-colonial project by means of discrimination against the indigenous Crimean Tatar people, persecution of political prisoners, and mass resettlement of Russian citizens to the occupied territory. Since 2014, Ukraine has rediscovered Crimea and Crimean Tatars. While the general perception of Crimean Tatars has become more positive within Ukrainian society, there is still no agreement on the future of the de-occupied peninsula. While Ukrainian society generally agrees that Crimea should be an integral part of Ukraine, some of the views about Crimea’s future are rooted in the narratives produced by colonizers for the purposes of colonization. This essay shows that military de-occupation does not equal decolonization and that some complicated questions remain unanswered.},

  abstract = {The Soviet Union as a colonial power in Central Asia decided to step up against the perceived traditional marginalisation of women. It intended to create an equal society for men and women, and treated women as important allies in the modernisation and the restructuration of traditional societies. However, in reality, while the Soviet initiatives contributed to the emancipation and empowerment of women on the surface, in the meantime they also served as a significant tool for the colonisation of Central Asia. The aim of the article is to shed light on this almost entirely overlooked process of the Soviet colonial power using the ideas of Marxist feminism to strengthen its power over the region, and to argue that this approach had contributed to the fact that the attempts of the Soviet Union aimed at the emancipation and empowerment of Central Asian women could only reach their declared objectives on the surface.},

This film, 235 Million Faces, drew on the example of The 6th Part of the World, but especially it was the opportunity to re-examine key questions of organization of the production of a collective documentary film of this scale~: rejection of the scenario, coordinated and flexible collective organization, exploration of human behaviour by the camera.

  abstract = {Researchers who deal with Soviet political art focus mainly on the 1930s–1950s. This of course was the time when, in our history, the relationship between art and politics was being shaped most dramatically. Stalinist political power produced its own political discourse, one that exerted its influence over all the media under its domain to an extraordinary degree. This was a time when art was superimposed by political statements, and visual discourses were dominated by textual ones. Relationship between art and politics in the period following the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, known as the “Thaw”, and the later years of political stagnation, become less clear and more complicated. One must presume that the recognition of a deconstruction of political text as a result of the intervisuality of visual discourse confirms the need to revise our accustomed interpretation of the history of Soviet art. The story of Soviet art is not about the struggle between artists and politicians, it is the story of the contradictory engagement of visual discourse in political text. It is the story of the struggle and interaction between textual and visual modes of communication that resulted in different models of political art dominated by textual and visual engagement – rather than by textual or visual engagement alone.},

It suggests that, on a national level, some memory policies implemented by the Lithuanian state can be seen as hegemonizing. Ethnic and ethno-regional categories constitute the content of these policies. They are reinforced by historical stereotypes about the region and its inhabitants, the majority of whom are Lithuanian Poles. During this process, local memories are being ignored, thus turned into counter-memories that emphasize the multi-layered identification formulas of the local inhabitants. Using an interdisciplinary approach, this article analyzes the place of the region in the Lithuanian historical metanarrative that developed over the last century.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            While it is often assumed that reconciliation culminates in the comprehensive resolution of conflict between deeply alienated parties, the article argues that reconciliation can only be achieved through complex mechanisms of estrangement that reveal alternative vistas or collective renewal. Art performs an important role in this process. The article theorizes estrangement as both an artistic and a political technique that can have world-disclosing, rather than alienating, effects on its audience: what Svetlana Boym calls estrangement for, rather than from, the world. I tease out the implications of this insight by examining the South African theater piece               Ubu and the Truth Commission               , which employs a number of estrangements devices in order to problematize the ambiguities and uncertainties of the post-Apartheid transition period. By subverting audience identification, yet triggering emotional contagion, the play imaginatively opens up the possibility of a common world in which agonistic relations are productively negotiated, rather than fully suppressed.},

In disciplinary terms this syndrome is manifested in the social sciences versus area studies divide from which the post-Soviet is either excluded or equalized with postcolonial discourses. The situation can be described as a general invisibility of the post-Soviet space and its social sciences and scientists for the rest of the world and the refusal of the global North to accept the postSoviet scholar in the capacity of a rational subject. The reasons for this complex intersection of the post-Soviet, postcolonial and other postdependence factors are both internal and external, political and epistemic. Following the methodological principles of decolonial option the author analyses such specific elements of the post-Soviet stagnant configuration in knowledge production as the external imperial difference and the double colonial difference, the geo-politics and body-politics of knowledge the way they are reflected in the knowledge production and distribution, paying specific attention to possible ways out of this epistemic dead-end.},

  abstract = {By taking into account dissident/political and art historical interpretations of Soviet art, I analyze how polemics about totalitarianism in the West, which generally corresponded with Cold War debates and Eastern European dissident thought, shaped the post-Soviet evaluations of national artistic legacies. It is argued that the political relationship with the totalitarian past, like in many post-socialist areas where the immediate past was subjected to radical re-evaluation, affected Lithuanian artists’ and critics’ attitude towards local Soviet art. Because of an obvious lack of underground art in Soviet Lithuania, however, the retrospective usage of political categories here became problematic. Especially in international representations, the complexities of artists’ relationship with officialdom came to be routinely assigned to the phenomenon of non-conformism; this eventually obfuscated the differences between the Lithuanian Soviet art context as somewhat different from the Russian case.},

  abstract = {Similar visual forms can have different meanings and the messages that symbols carry are context specific. Some of the symbols are inevitably contested due to their historical uses. This article explores what is probably the most notorious of contested symbols: the swastika and its local variant in Latvia, the ugunskrusts (Cross of Fire). With the aim of analyzing vernacular narratives connected with contemporary uses of the ugunskrusts in Latvia, the article focuses on situations in which there is a conscious choice to use the ugunskrusts with the intention of reclaiming and rehabilitating the symbol for artistic and spiritual reasons, based on a belief in the symbol’s benign nature and with the help of narratives of cultural heritage. Despite these claims, however, the cases are not just about symbols or cultural heritage, but are just as much about historical conflicts in the past and current political affairs. Thus, the article shows how different national experiences of crimes committed by totalitarian regimes of the twentieth century determine the interpretation of, and attitude toward, the use of symbols connected with these regimes. I examine how collective memory battles are mirrored in the use of this contested symbol. Despite the voices that deny the negative connotation of the symbol locally, the image of the swastika in the western world is inevitably tied to Nazism. Therefore, I look at how the attitude toward this symbol correlates with the interpretation of World War II in the collective memory of Latvia. The article is based on in-depth ethnographic interviews conducted since 2017.},

  abstract = {The Polish version of this article was published in Roczniki Humanistyczne vol. 65, issue 1 (2017).  This paper proposes a postcolonial reading of antiquity motifs from Zbigniew Herbert’s po-ems from the times of socialism. References to ancient history, mythology, and biblical allusions are interpreted as allegories of the political culture in the Polish People’s Republic. While in his poems written between 1956 and 1990 Herbert depicts communism as an attempt at Russian colonization of Poland, in seminal texts the focus lies mainly on the internal effects for the Polish colonized mind.  Linking communist Moscow to ancient Rome, Herbert accomplishes a peculiar anti-imperial translatio imperii. It is this trans-chronic perspective of Herbert’s poems which allows for rounding off the paper with connecting Herbert’s anti-imperial attitude with defensive nationalism and proposing recent right-wing tendencies in the Polish appropriation of post-colonial theory (Ewa Thompson et al.) as a heuristic model for understanding Herbert’s civil position during communism.},

  abstract = {The subject as modelled in contemporary literature has to be capable of making choices, but without suppressing the other. In other words it must both have free will and not have it. In Russian poetry we can find such models in the texts of Dmitrii Prigov and Arkadii Dragomoshchenko. Prigov offers two levels of the subject. The first represents a subject-mask as an incarnation of any language practice: on this level, the will as a stereotype is deconstructed. The subject of the second level slides between subjects of the first; but this movement is evidence of free will. In contrast, Dragomoshchenko’s subject is fluid: he has no fixed boundaries, erases himself, and limits his own will in order to clear a space for the will of other subjects that interest him. In this manner, Dragomoshchenko’s subject accesses a stream of events from which he draws material for self-construction. Prigov’s subject is social, whereas Dragomoshchenko’s subject is asocial; however, they have a similar foundation in will. An approach to the problem of will for both lies in changes that lead the subject to new and interesting forms not yet ossified in any definite structure.},

Both of these films re-evaluate the way animals are being represented in cinema. The analysis will be conducted within three frameworks: Lithuanian poetic documentary, nature or wildlife documentaries and animal studies in the field of film studies. While both “Acid Forest” and “Animus Animalis” employ cinematic language that is common to Lithuanian poetic documentary, they both broaden the genre not only with their aesthetic decisions, but also by extending its thematic focus usually limited to human interest. By changing the elements of conventional nature or wildlife documentaries these films manage to question the power dynamics of different species. They create a new sensibility towards nonhuman living creatures by reorganizing the point of view usually belonging to human beings, even by limiting spatial and temporal freedom of the spectator. Interdisciplinary focus on animal studies within the field of film studies sets another important framework that helps us understand why “Acid Forest” and “Animus Animalis” become relevant case studies: they widen the field of documentary cinema in the local context and they are also a part of a global shift in documentary filmmakers’ approach towards nonhuman beings.},

The aim is to create a web of associations for these perspectives and perceive a wider approach on documentary in order to argue that the meaningful appropriation of various tendencies in documentary studies requires sufficient correspondence and dialogical proneness for an understanding of the conceptual, formal and aesthetic legitimacy of this phenomenon.},

  abstract = {My article studies the implications of Jacques Rancière's concepts of literary misunderstanding and political dissensus for our understanding of the politics of postcolonial fiction. The disjunctive junction that Rancière establishes between the politics of aesthetics and the aesthetics of politics constitutes the starting point of my investigation. For Rancière, the original disjunction of aesthetics forecloses the equivalence between literary misunderstanding and political dissensus. Aesthetics practices a metapolitics, which can only take the form of a denunciation of the false scene of politics, the invocation of a fusional community to come, or the evocation of an atomized, molecular, apathic, indifferent equality that renders political equality inoperable. My article questions the hermeneutics of Rancière's paradigm of aesthetics. Showing how Rancière's thinking of politics is shaped first and foremost by a sustained inquiry into the poetics of sense, or an aisthesis (the experience of sense, sensation, and sensibility), I try to bridge the conceptual gap he establishes between the sensible of aesthetics and the sensible of politics. Using a postcolonial novel, Tahar Djaout's Le dernierété de la raison (The Last Summer of Reason), as an example, I show how literary fiction stages acts of political subjectivation that Rancière reserves for the scene of political dissensus. I argue that Djaout constructs a heterologic and heterotopic poetics of sense (an aisthesis) that stages a different meaning of emancipation and equality. Allegory and metaphor enact the fragile power of a political dissensus as a fictional construction in the mode of an as if.},

Salinger’s The Catcher in the Rye (1951) into Russian and Latvian are analyzed in this article in the context of the political circumstances and censorship of the Soviet regime, the impacts of a canonical translation on subsequent translation versions, and the centralized translation instructions enforced upon Soviet Latvia. The first Russian translation of the novel included substantial lexical changes and given its canonical status, this impacted later Russian versions. Moreover, centralized instructions for translations into the languages of the Soviet republics compromised the quality of translation. It is also argued that the revised Latvian translation of the novel was produced in the shadow of the authoritative first translation.},

  abstract = {The focus of the article is on South Estonian literature, with an aim to provide a survey of the phenomenon while discussing problems that arise in describing it. These problems are related to the small size of the literary corpus, transformation of modes of description through history, and variations in concepts. Irrespective of the problems, it seems useful to treat South Estonian literature as a separate set of texts; taking the use of South Estonian language as the defining characteristic appears to be the most productive approach. The administrative and linguistic history of South Estonia is different from that of North Estonia and has influenced the development of regional identities. Starting from the 17th century, texts in South Estonian would be published mostly in the form of religious literature, and a South Estonian literary language based on the Tartu dialect was formed. The tradition based on religious literature disappeared at the beginning of the 20th century, while other, and more explicitly literary, opportunities to employ South Estonian language arose. A new wave of South Estonian poetry introduced the second period of South Estonian literature in 1917, during which it was mostly considered as a dialectal branch of Estonian literature. 1987 marked the beginning of a third period that has been characterised by the emergence of literature written in the Võru dialect and the spread of the Võru cultural movement. This most recent stage has brought about changes in the interpretative framework within which South Estonian literature is being discussed.},

While some poets of the younger generation, like Maris Melgalvs and Peters Bruveris, created their own poetical space within the context of folklore or ancient imagery, others, like Amanda Aizpuriete and Klavs Elsbergs, absorbed the traditions of modern literature. Two key contributors to prose poetry in the 1980s were Uldis BerzirB, whose three collections of poems include prose poems questioning various periods of Latvian history, and Imants Ziedonis, with the prose poems in his collection Attack of the Butterflies (1988). At the end of the 1980s it was possible to open up a discussion with the official ideology and to challenge its viewpoints; this can be seen in the prose poems of Guntars GodinL Viktors Livzemnieks and Imants Ziedonis, as well as Uldis Berzins. Prose poems also documented the process of national awakening, becoming much like newspaper columns in their comments on current events and the conflicting ideologies of national self-determination and Soviet imperialism.},

  abstract = {In nineteenth-century Romantic poetry, the lyric “I” was usually identified with the poet himself. This changed at the beginning of the twentieth century, when poets (Pound and Eliot, for instance) introduced speakers (“personae”) into their poetry who were clearly different from themselves. Instead of “the poet”, new terms were introduced to refer to the speaker in the poem. In German lyric theory, the term “das lyrische Ich” (“the lyric I”) became popular, as in Russian did “liricheskii geroi” (“the lyric hero”). English and American critics generally use “the speaker” and “the poet” (often indiscriminately in the same book or article). As the speaker in the poem is, in principle, a fictive construct and cannot be identified with the poet, and as many poems do not have an “I”, this paper argues for the use of the term “the speaker”.},

  abstract = {Aesthetics has been a matter of politics and not only of philosophy from the very beginning. Its subversive power has for a long time been explored mostly in the context of artworks. However, it is only quite recently that the discourse of everyday aesthetics has been reaffirming the potential of aesthetics to affect the perception of the sensible. By indicating the ways that enable to redistribute the sensible, everyday aesthetics engages in going beyond the insurmountable divide between the sensuous and the intelligible, once established by Plato. The article intends to provide a theoretical basis for thinking the potential of everyday aesthetics in a political perspective. By questioning the nature of this redistribution in the Rancière’s thinking and indicating its possible configurations and applications in the present world, we intend to explore more extensively its implications for the discourse of everydays aesthetics. Is everyday aesthetics increasingly adopting a thoroughly nonmetaphysical and rather pragmatist attitude towards the ever-changing reality? Is the distribution of the sensible just another way to think the Platonic divide between the sensuous and the intelligible and their constant conflict in our experience? Is the potential of the politics to redistribute the sensible given in the emerging realm of everyday aesthetics. By exploring the connexion between politics and aesthetics, the article demonstrates the potential of Rancière’s theory for launching new explorations in the field of everyday aesthetics.},

The findings suggest that the synergy between transnationalism and local integration is protected against discursive suppression via mundane balancing acts. Furthermore, the securitization of transnational media practices of the Russian-speaking population may not always lead to the rise of diasporic identities as reported in earlier studies.},

  abstract = {The article discusses the commemorative concept of Gunter Demnig’s ongoing art project Stolpersteine, which is considered one of the world’s largest decentralised Holocaust memorials. Stolpersteine are small, cobblestone-size memorial stones in urban spaces which are dedicated to individual victims of Nazism; it is the project’s aim to install the stones in the pavement in front of an individual’s last-known place of residence. The article aims to analyse the commemorative facets of the project’s spatial dimension in relation to the concept of the ‘residential’. The value of dwelling, presented in Demnig’s project as a common ground for the commemoration of all victims as individual citizens, forms a predominant component in public reception. It contributes to a synthesising perception of each stone as being part of a vast commemorative landscape. This landscape, however, is semantically marked by an immanent concept of border, which suggests a polarising separation between included civil spaces and excluded heterotopias. By deviating from the project’s general principles of placement and inscription, certain individual stones render visible this implicit borderline, thereby also critically reflecting on concepts of ‘inside’ and ‘outside’.},

Beginning in the 1930s, following declaration of the doctrine on socialist realism as the official form of cultural production, Soviet authorities and filmmakers tailored films to the circumstances in the USSR at that given moment in order to influence and shape popular opinion; however, this often resulted in inconsistent and outright contradictory messages. Given the transformation that gender relations were undergoing in the early stages of development, one area that was particularly problematic in Soviet cinema was the portrayals of women. Focusing primarily on the Stalinist period of the Soviet History (1934-1953), I plan to look at the ways in which women were portrayed in popular Soviet cinema and specifically the ways in which these presentations shifted before, during, and after World War II.},

  abstract = {Contemporary art in the Baltic States has recently undergone a ‘documentary turn’, part of a global tendency towards the use of documentary aesthetics and formal structures in art. In the Baltic context, this has been the result of a desire amongst artists to both recognize and re-cognize the post-Soviet condition, a subject that was consciously avoided by most artists in Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania during the 1990s. Re-cognition has involved an attempt to de-flatten and humanize the postSoviet condition, which, although a valid framework for the theoretical discussion of Eastern Europe, has a number of shortcomings. This re-cognitive tendency has derived from a shift from ‘hot’ to ‘cold’ memory, the product of distance and detachment from the Soviet past and the rise of a new generation of artists, who were not active participants in the Soviet Baltic Republics. Artists have utilized documentary, as well as ethnographic and pedagogical strategies in order to achieve this re-cognition.},

  abstract = {In the 25 years since the re-establishment of Baltic independence from the Soviet Union, there has been no conclusive public conversation, or “coming to terms with the past” with respect to crimes against Latvian and other persecuted groups under Communism. This paper examines how national politicians, members of the European Parliament in Brussels, representatives of Latvia's Russian-speaking minority, and the Russian government have engaged in a difficult, long-overdue conversation. Conflicting historical narratives about victimhood are at the heart of these disagreements. Special emphasis is given to Latvia's historical narrative, its development over the past 25 years, and the way it challenges Russia's interpretation of history. I argue that Latvian memory politics at the European level are a continuation of Latvia's quest for acknowledgment of its victimhood, thereby trying to finish the process started in the late 1980s when Balts first demanded acknowledgment of human rights violations they had suffered under the Soviet regime. Latvia's methods of transitional justice are examined, arguing that its memory politics at the European level are an extension of steps taken at the national level to come to terms with the past and to increase its negotiating power against Russia's neo-Soviet historical narrative.},

  abstract = {This paper explores the notion of hospitality and faith in Derrida and Kierkegaard. The aim is to trace the topological core of existence in relation to an ongoing debate in contemporary continental philosophy of religion about khôra. The paper shows how khôral traces are at work in Kierkegaard’s thinking in relation to the topological proximity of love. The claim is that Kierkegaard emphasizes the vulnerability rather than the hostility of what I coin khôral love as the vibrating space between the anonymous and the amorous, call and response. The unknown X of the khôral becomes the topos of existence – the “stepping out”, the “you are here (X)”. A “you” called forth by the commandment of love or the visitation of the stranger.},

  abstract = {Jacques Ranciere discusses disapprovals (“Dissensus”) as “differences in opinion” within the limits of common sense: discussions about what is given, about the system where we perceive something as given”. The article analyses the Baltic Way of August 1989 as an example of political disapproval, when “two worlds find themselves in one world”. On 23 August 1989, a 600 km human chain connected Tallinn, Riga and Vilnius in order to condemn the Pact of Molotov-Ribbentrop on its 50th anniversary. It was a symbolic event uniting three Soviet republics and an act of protest against the occupation of three independent states in 1939 and in favour of the right to the restoration of independence. As an expression of national and international solidarity, the Baltic Way challenged the Soviet interpretation of history, since it contradicted the statement that the Baltic States joined the Soviet Union on their own free will. Almost 2 million participants of this campaign clearly showed the reality of mass resistance against the Soviet authorities. Moreover, this event drew a new political and geographical map, highlighting national borders between the Baltic States, which were considered as administrative borders in the Soviet period, not as political units. At the same time it created a physical link uniting the three Baltic States. By disputing the geopolitical system, the Baltic Way clearly demonstrated disapproval thus elevating the right to national citizenship and independence, which had been neglected over 50 years, and predicting the collapse of the Soviet Union and the Iron Curtain.},

This article re-evaluates this assumption by examining his pieces for Novyi LEF in 1927 and 1928 and his pivotal contributions to the 1929 anthology Literatura fakta (Literature of Fact). The author focuses on Tret’iakov’s appropriation of Vladimir Arsen’ev’s ethnographic writing and devotes special attention to his review of the latter’s V debriakh Ussuriiskogo kraia (In the Wilds of Ussuriland, 1926/1928) – celebrated by Tret’iakov as “one of the most remarkable books in the field of factual prose”. The analysis confronts Tretiakov’s invention and practice of factography with Arsen’ev’s prose and his scriptwriting collaboration on Aleksandr Litvinov’s ethnographic film Lesnye liudi (Forest people, 1928). Whereas Tret’iakov pursues codified signification and a rational approach towards the recording of facts, disregarding “primitive” perception, Arsen’ev emphasises the native’s mimetic ability to perceive and communicate sensual phenomena beyond verbal or analogue codes. Thus, where Tret’iakov aims for a non-hierarchical participatory observation, Arsen’ev, in part, achieves it.},

By the late 1950s international postwar modernism became an official Soviet architectural style. The article explains how Soviet architects discovered and learned this new style: through magazines and books, both translated and in their original languages through business and tourist trips abroad and through personal connections and official channels. The main argument is that in the 1960s Soviet architecture became embedded in an international system of architecture but at its far periphery. Moreover, the visual westernizing makeover of Soviet architecture did not change its inner structure and has rather negative implications for the perception and evaluation of the architectural legacy of the post-Stalin era.},

  abstract = {The article is devoted to understanding the image of the Soviet editor in Russian art (using examples of fiction and cinema). The author examines the personal qualities that contributed to the entry of a person into the profession («editorial character») and provides a chronological observation of the «editorial evolution» – in publishing and film production-throughout the Soviet period and the first years of Russia in the 1990s. An important aspect that has been updated since the early 1920s is the active inclusion of women in editorial work. The characteristics of editors of different Soviet periods are analyzed using examples from the prose of M. Bulgakov, V. Shishkov, L. Rakhmanov, A. Tobolyak, V. Astafyev. Portraits of Soviet film editors are considered in the works of J.  Gausner, N.  Bogoslovsky, V.  Makanin, D.  Rubina and M.  Kuraev. Representatives of the editorial profession are also represented in the films of A. Tarkovsky, V. Zheregy, K. Shakhnazarov and A. Benckendorf. There are two main types in the artistic depiction of editors and their activities: satirical (in a pointed form ridiculing personal and professional shortcomings) and dramatic (reflecting the complexity of editorial characters in their inseparability with the influence of society, historical era). In the final part of the article, the vectors of professional diffusions in the film-editing corps are outlined with the end of the Soviet era and the need to adapt to the new, post-Soviet realities.},

  abstract = {The present research investigates the parallelism between Derrida’s reading of Plato’s Khora and Samuel Beckett’s The Unnamable. Out of the rationality of logos, both resist being named and defined. Indeed, the complexity in their comprehension is due to their rejecting the rules and principles of language. As language constructs mentality, whatever is out of its boundaries, remains unnamable. In deconstructing Khora and The Unnamable, based on logos/mythos binary opposition, their mise en abyme structures resemble mythos to some extent, while the criteria are not met thoroughly. All the philosophical efforts in defining their essence fail and both remain inexplicable at the end. While deconstructing them based on different binary oppositions, we reach this point that they can be both and, at the same time, neither this nor that. The fact is that the Unnamable and Khora are situated somewhere between participation and exclusion. Oscillating at the threshold of presence/absence binary opposition, both can be comparable to subjectile, where the act of becoming is possible and the appropriate context for artistic representation happens to be. Khora acts as a vessel of creation of beings and forms, and The Unnamable creates a space for forming a narration out of the words. In the end, due to the lack of essence, none of them retains anything and both remains intact and neutral. In the end, all the efforts in attributing right characteristics to pin them down would lead into a pile of interpretations and metaphors, which are not referable and reliable and cannot be accounted more than a couple of subjective projections. Their existence and any determination toward their reality remain questionable.},

  abstract = {Communist governments in Europe believed that the state should enable the provision of material goods to its people—food, clothing, and shelter among the most critical of these needs. A long-term strategy for how to achieve this goal was left unresolved in the iconic texts and statements of the international communist movement. Architects, planners, and economists had to develop their own solutions to the vexing question of housing for the masses. As part of their work, they had to respond to the new planning regimens of the command economy and institutional structures such as the Five-Year Plan. While the perils of mass production have received much scholarly attention, this essay argues that an alternative base of knowledge about architectural modernism can be mobilized from the history of communist mass housing programs. This model of architecture—referred to here as “serial architecture”—embodied both an aesthetic approach and an ethical stance that remains relevant to enduring questions of the built environment’s agency in creating and sustaining social progress.},

This article revisits the socialist city and argues for the validity of the concept historically and in the present. Looking qualitatively at this distinct paradigm in Europe, two analytical frameworks are offered, infrastructural thinking and the socialist scaffold. The analysis shows that the universal aspiration for socialist cities was their continuous operation as synchronized instruments of economic production and social transformation in physical space. Distinct from capitalist cities, they had an ideological role in an economic model that instrumentalized cities as nodes in an integrated system, described using Stephen Kotkin’s term, “single entity.” The agency of the socialist scaffold has continued into the era of neoliberalism, shown here to have previously unexplored roots in socialism.},

  abstract = {Riga, the capital of Soviet Latvia, was the first city in the USSR where television was created outside the Slavic linguistic space. This presented Soviet television with a brand new challenge of tackling bilingualism in the only available television programme, bringing with it viewer frustration as reflected in letters addressed to the studio. To relieve the republican television studios and their only programmes from the issue of bilingualism, in 1960, the CPSU called for the creation of a second republican programme – the retransmission of Moscow’s Central Television. This article tracks the development of the issue, focusing on the case study of a western-orientated, non-Slavic Soviet republic where negotiations regarding the place of Russian in a given field of public life took fifteen years, involving stakeholders of various levels. Thus, the article offers an opportunity to study certain aspects of Soviet nationality policies in the Soviet Western periphery under Khrushchev and Brezhnev from the viewpoint of a single, specified problem.},

The newest verbosity cannot be defined in the genre-type system of literature, it is “language dramaturgy”, it is in the complex system of relations with different kinds of discourse. It is characterized by increased reflexivity, with aesthetic negativism and project activity being its means of implementation. Text is an “instrument of position building”; it organizes the subject. Poetry can have an impact on social practice if it is created at the intersection of cognitive and communicative issues, and develops “new images of events and actions”.},

  abstract = {This article discusses different versions of subjectivity in contemporary Russian poetry. De-subjectification ‒ i.e. the use of different forms of indirect statement –is often deemed to be the most important tendency in modern Russian poetry. This tendency is, meanwhile, put at odds with an attempt to preserve a lyrical “ego” as the carrier of catastrophic, transgressive experience. In this context, to be the subject means to experience painful metamorphoses; to claim to be in the act of transgression; to transition through the limit of trauma and pain. This article identifies some aspects and strains of such subjectivity: the “constructive,” which creates the illusion of a conventional “masked” subject; the “orphic,” which implies reference to the fragmentary nature of the “ego” and the value of madness in poetic experience; and the “parodic,” which combines intense painful experiences with an ironic attitude towards suffering. All these variants consolidate the multidimensionality of the world and the interpretation of the “wound” as the “eye,” which allow us to establish new cause and effect relationships.},

Vincas Mykolaitis-Putinas is the author whose works symbolically represent a turning point in Lithuanian literature. Finding himself in a difficult and ambiguous situation, having entered priesthood, the traditional education for peasant children, he had to break the ties with his past and gain status as an independent artist. The theme of choice, authentic life and questions of the human place in the universe found their poetic expression in the meditative poetry of Mykolaitis-Putinas. In the poetry of his last period, the theme of death becomes important and Heidegger’s concept “Being-toward-death” (“Sein zum Tode”) emerges as the last thrilling problem. Mykolaitis-Putinas had an impact on the younger generation of Lithuanian poets to whom existential problems were self-evident.},

  abstract = {This article discusses the ambivalent discourses of cinematography and memory. It aims to show that a deeper exploration of memory is related to the development of cinema, which actualizes memory-as-image. Visualizing realities that are exposed to individuals as the remembering, cinema has become a part of memory technologies, which gives meaning to the emotional memory and at the same time plunges memory into the ocean of controversial visual culture, meaninglessness and oblivion. As the form of prosthetic memory and the extension of human consciousness, cine ma began to reflect on the memory and encouraged the development of memory discourse in the twentieth century. It contributed to the merging of collective memory into individual memories, to the replacing “history” with “memory” and grand narrative with many small, local layers of remembrance, to the revival of oral history and simple human experience. This opening of cinematic perspective, that weaves past and present, established new forms and practices of cultural memory. It can be observed that the profound impact of cinema on the collective imagination and memory drew attention to the national cinematography as an important tool to mobilize citizens, activate communities, reflect, reinforce and transform identity structures. Lithuanian cinematic culture survived the crisis at the intersection of XX–XXI c. and also began to reflect on the processes of remembering and recall. The disclosure of traumatic, repressed, false memory and its creative conversion into long-term post-memory become one of the major tasks of cinema as a medium of cultural memory. Many different motifs of memory can be seen in documentaries as well as feature films.},

  abstract = {The choice of the topic of this paper was inspired by the search of new directions of research and methods in political sciences. Film as the source of history still has no acknowledgment in many countries and especially in Lithuania: there are no scientific texts (of political studies) here, but references to political context of film can be found in individual works of Lithuanian scholars (mostly in discussions on Soviet film). New method of interpretation was chosen for the analysis of the forms of communism – one of the most researched issues in the world. The difficulties that were faced during the search for literature in Lithuanian as well as other countries were mostly determined by the novelty of the topic itself. Not many authors have seen the possibilities of film as a source of information. This work discusses all major texts of these theorists: John E. O‘Connor, Pierre Sorlin and Marc Ferro. Their insights have provided a robust foundation for further analysis. Meanwhile, the philosophical reflections of Slavoj Žižek, that have revived the traditional philosophy by incorporating it into the popular culture, i.e. reality, allowed not only to penetrate the nature of complexity of the film position among the scholars, which was influenced by the tight narrative of medial culture studies, but also provided reasons and solutions of this problem. The goal of the study is to determine the possibilities of film as the source of information. Two hypotheses are formulated as the base for the analysis:  Film can be justly incorporated in the sphere of academic studies as a tool/source of research.  The nature of historical-political film may be either neorealistic, or as a form of aesthetisation. This paper includes a qualitative study. The concept of an historical film as the main carrier of the film genre and its features shall play the key role in this analysis. It differentiates, provides the key units for the study and even draws a certain scheme for the treatment of political film in social research. The last statement predetermines the peculiarity of the analysis – film as an historical source. The first, theoretical, part shall identify two issues related to the film theory – lack of organised methodology and the tendency of the definition of the historical film itself towards ambivalence. The following article describes possible methods of film analysis that are important for the interpretation of selected movies. Discussing of the definition of an historical-political film is not enough to validate the first hypothesis – in such case, the position of cinematography in the scale of the new methods of research as well as political sciences (in terms of search for new directions) would still be uncertain. One of the parts of the paper includes a philosophical study and looks at the film as the philosophy and new directions. The process of search is based on nonprobability sampling of filmography. Samples were chosen in accordance with the goal and according to the Sorlin’s definition. The following additional criteria were defined: period, political implication and artistic value. Vytautas Žalakevičius, Almantas Grikevičius, Raimondas Vabalas, Eldar Ryazanov, Luchino Visconti, Bernardo Bertolucci and Hans Peter Molland were the filmmakers with a delicate creative sense that enriched their works with originality in terms of political implication as well as artistic style. All works of the directors reviewed here (“Nobody Wanted to Die”, “One Day Chronicle”, “Feelings”, “Ladder to the Sky”, “Watch out for the Automobile”, “Rocco and His Brothers”, “1900”, “The Dreamers” and “Comrade Pedersen”) are related to the same period of time – 1960s and 1970s – and have been ‘marked’ by it. The filmmakers who associated this period with the appearance of new ideas, artistic uplift and the coming of historical changes represent the period in question with a detachment or through direct contact. Some of the works (“Nobody Wanted to Die”, “One Day Chronicle”, “Feelings”, “Ladder to the Sky”, “Watch out for the Automobile”, “Rocco and His Brothers”) reflect and interpret the present (of the past), while the others (“1900”, “The Dreamers” and “Comrade Pedersen”) reconstruct the past. The choice between these two narrative lines was predetermined by the pretension to the historical reality and the aim to introduce adequate analysis of the past. Therefore, both the subsistence (the reality of the present moment, perception, which has a tendency to change in time) and the ability of the author to reproduce historical events with ‘detachment’, after a period of time, during which unknown details of the past could have been revealed.},

  abstract = {In this article, motifs, references and influences of Latvian descent in the poetry of Lithuanian Henrikas Nagys (1920–1996) who spent most of his creative life in Canada are observed and analyzed. Nagys was praised by critics as one of the main modernizers of the national poetical vocabulary; nevertheless he was regarded as one of the most emotionally suggestive and ideologically engaged poets of Lithuanian Western exile. He belonged to the Žemininkai movement which played an important role transforming lyrical tradition in the diaspora during the 1950s; the members of this group were deeply influenced by the post-Naturalist trends of Western Modernism and Existentialist philosophy; they were members of the generation which got educated in the gymnasiums of independent Lithuania. Nagys used to translate contemporary Latvian authors who had the similar experience and who adopted the mythic Baltic heritage but at the same time reflected some kind of Protestant simplicity and sobriety, natural vitalism and economy of expression. Nagys promoted Latvian poetical tradition introducing Velta Sniķere, Gunars Saliņš, Aina Kraujiete, Aina Zemdega, and Astrīde Ivaska in his Lithuanian translations. Simplified Latvian poetical style with its free versification, pure images and folklore-based models of spatial and chronological organization was reflected in Nagys’ later poems. His links with Latvia were biographical, based on childhood memories; however his imaginary landscape was a result of fusion of universal Northern features. Nagys popularized the symbolism of the North, and Latvian place-names were included into the map of his identity.},
