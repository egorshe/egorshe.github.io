# 📚 CSL Testing Document: MLA 9th Edition

This document demonstrates how the `jekyll-scholar` plugin processes in-text citations and generates a bibliography using your `references.bib` file and the **MLA 9th edition** CSL style.

## In-Text Citation Scenarios

### 1. Standard Citation (Article or Book)

The core argument of the research is that institutional history shapes national identity {% cite abdelalMemoriesNationsStates2002 --page 462 %}. This is a standard author-page citation test.

### 2. Multiple Works by the Same Author (Disambiguation)

To test author/year disambiguation, we cite two different works by the same author, even if they have the same publication year in your BibTeX file. The style should correctly distinguish them, usually by adding an 'a' or 'b' if necessary (though MLA uses author-title for disambiguation, the CSL will handle the internal differentiation).

* First work cited: {% cite abdelalMemoriesNationsStates2002 --page 470a %}
* Second work cited: {% cite abdelalMemoriesNationsStates2002b --page 470b %}

### 3. Multiple Authors (Using "et al.")

For works with three or more authors, MLA uses the first author's last name followed by "et al." in the in-text citation.

* This work has many authors: {% cite annusEtAlCultureConcept1995 --page 545 %}.

### 4. Chapter in an Edited Collection

When citing a chapter or work within an edited book, the citation should only show the **chapter author's** last name, not the editor's.

* The discussion on the cocktail generation can be found here: {% cite adinolfiMondoExoticaSounds2008 -l 45 %}.

### 5. Works with No Fixed Locator (Webpage/Online)

For online sources that lack fixed page numbers, the MLA style dictates omitting the locator entirely.

* An important perspective on American religions is offered by Abigail {% cite abigailSpacePlaceRevisited %}.

### 6. Works Missing Key Data (Robustness Test)

The CSL should handle entries with missing data gracefully. This is a general test for entries that may be missing volumes, numbers, or standard fields.

* An incomplete entry should still cite by author: {% cite adornoAestheticTheory1997 --page 160 %}.

### 7. Non-English and Non-Standard Entries

Test the processing of works with non-Latin scripts (Cyrillic) and non-standard BibTeX entry types (like `misc` or an entry with collaborative authors).

* A work on Russian politics: {% cite abashinBratskieNarodySistemy %}.
* A collaborative work: {% cite adaskinaTregubovaEtoByloNavsegda2020 --page 10 %}.

## Works Cited (Bibliography)

The `jekyll-scholar` plugin will generate the bibliography list here. We use the `full: true` option to force every entry in `references.bib` to appear, fully testing the CSL's bibliography formatting rules (sorting, hanging indent, repeat author substitution).

{% bibliography --cited %}

***

### Expected Formatting Tests

* **Hanging Indent:** Each entry should have a hanging indent (first line flush left, subsequent lines indented).
* **Double Spacing:** Lines should be double-spaced (depending on your CSS).
* **Author Substitution:** If two consecutive entries are by the exact same author(s), the second entry should replace the author name(s) with three dashes (e.g., `———`).
* **Entry Types:** All source types (`@article`, `@book`, `@incollection`, `@phdthesis`, `@online`, etc.) from your `references.bib` should be correctly formatted according to MLA 9th rules.
* **Sorting:** Entries should be sorted alphabetically by the first element (usually the first author's last name).
