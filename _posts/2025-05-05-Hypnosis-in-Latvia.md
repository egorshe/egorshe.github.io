Letter to the Ventspils District Executive Committee regarding the prohibition of hypnotic performances
(Ventspils ZVA, 47.1.81.15)

> In recent months, several regions and republics have reported appearances by hypnotists, various “psycho-experimenters,” so-called “long-distance mind readers,” and similar performers. None of these shows have any connection to science or to art, and the so-called “hypnotists” are, in most cases, untrained individuals whose activities are harmful.

> The Head Repertoire Committee once again informs all authorized bodies of the categorical ban on all forms of hypnotist performances and demonstrations of hypnotic sessions. In exceptional cases, specific psychological demonstrations from older, vetted programs may be permitted, but only with the approval of the Head Repertoire Committee.

> Head of the Administration for the Supervision of Spectacles and Repertoire  
> O. Babin
