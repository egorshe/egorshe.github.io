<details markdown="1"><summary>Abstract</summary>
Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022 has been described as an “inflection” point, a “post-colonial moment” which has fundamentally reshaped identities and memory politics in Central Eastern Europe, including the Baltic states (Mälksoo 2022; Michta 2022). Is it really so? What was the transformative power of this event, as distinct from that of other epochal turns, such as the collapse of the USSR? How does this event as a “critical situation” compare to the other, relatively recent developments in identity and memory politics? To gain insight into these questions, this paper will analyze the evolution of memory regime in Lithuania (with references to the other two Baltic states) since the disintegration of the Soviet Union, assessing the impact of Soviet collapse, the return of Russian aggression with the invasion of Ukraine in 2014, and the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022. The focus here is on these events as “decolonizing moment(s)” (Maria Mälksoo’s term) with transformative power. Which identities, which agencies became pronounced during these “critical situations”? Which new discourses were articulated? How do the developments in memory regimes during Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine compare to the previous “critical situations” (the disintegration of the Soviet Union and the events in 2014)? The paper consists of three structured case studies (1991, 2014 and 2022) that include the developments in Lithuania’s memory landscape, analysis of the debates and tensions surrounding the removal of Soviet-era monuments and other processes associated with “mnemonic decolonization”—attempts to transcend the Soviet colonization of national memory and establish a new memory regime supportive of national resilience and security. The goal of the case studies is to capture processes associated with mnemonic decolonization, understood as breaking away from colonial memory regimes and assertion of new subaltern subjectivities, and explore their relationship with mnemonic securitization.

"Between Empire and Nationhood: Competing Narratives on the Latvian War of Independence." *Language, Individual & Society*, vol. 19, 2025.
<details markdown="1"><summary>Abstract</summary>
The article examines competing narratives about the Latvian War of Independence through the lens of memoirs by Andrievs Niedra and Pavel Bermondt-Avalov. The study aims to demonstrate how personal and collective memories are constructed within autobiographical texts and function as tools in the symbolic struggle for historical legitimacy. The methods of memoir and narratology are employed as the methodological foundation. The research materials - two sets of memoirs written by the authors in the 1920s and 1930s - enable us to trace how each narrator selects and organises facts, appealing to different cultural frameworks: Latvian national memory and Russian emigration discourse. Narratological analysis shows that the choice of emplotment influences the ideological tone: in one case, the events are depicted as a tragic struggle of a ‘traitor of the people,’ while in another, as a heroic tribute to anti-Bolshevism. The results of the study demonstrate that memoirs are not passive accounts but active shapers of historical reality, where personal memory is ‘stitched’ together using cultural codes and collective myths. The processes of self-representation and ideological selectivity, through which authors aim to justify their positions, are uncovered.

Balodis, Gunārs. *Cits kino. Latviešu kino mākslinieka dzīve un darbs*. Latvijas mediji, 2025. [link](https://izdevnieciba.latvijasmediji.lv/lv/jaunumi/9789934296581)
<details markdown="1"><summary>Annotation</summary>
The life story of film artist Gunārs Balodis, which simultaneously reveals the development of Latvian cinema history and the upheavals of the 20th century. The author tells of his family roots in Cēsis, the fates of his parents and grandparents during years of war, revolution, and changes in power, as well as his own professional path—from the Janis Rozentāls School to studies at the then-prestigious Moscow Institute of Cinematography (VGIK).
The book highlights the artist's contribution to the creation of Latvian cinema, his collaboration with directors such as Rolands Kalniņš and Aloizs Brenčs, and his unique artistic style and experience. Personal tragedies and memories of contemporaries are woven into the text, supplementing the portrait with human warmth. "Cits kino" (Another Cinema) is a story of an artist's perseverance, his creative world, and Latvia’s cultural heritage.

"Governing and Living Through Failure: Russian Speakers in Ethnocentric Nation‐Building Projects of Estonia and Latvia." *Nations and Nationalism*, https://doi.org/10.1111/nana.70048.
<details markdown="1"><summary>Abstract</summary>
This article contributes to nationalism studies by demonstrating how states use failure as a governance tool to regulate national belonging and by showing how people experience and reinterpret failure in ways that unsettle dominant national imaginaries. Drawing on ethnographic research with Russian speakers in Estonia and Latvia, we explore how individuals cast outside ‘communities of value’ as ‘failures’ negotiate such experiences differently across generations. We show that while state discourses frequently frame Russophones as failing national cohesion, their mundane withdrawal or occasional refusal of dominant discourses, frequently dismissed as passive or disobedient, can be read as subtle acts of care and agency that sustain alternative modes of life. Situating these experiences within literature on failure, we argue that failure is not merely deviation from national norms but a historically sedimented, affective and generative condition that illuminates the contradictions of ethnocentric nation-building while opening space for reimagined forms of national membership.

Senvaitytė, Dalia. "Modern Pagan Traditions in Lithuania: Navigating Romantic Nostalgia and Creativity in Ritual Year Celebrations." *The Yearbook of Balkan and Baltic Studies*, vol. 8, no. 1, https://www.folklore.ee/balkan_baltic_yearbook/YBBS/article/view/318/295.
<details markdown="1"><summary>Abstract</summary>
This paper examines annual celebrations among Native Faith communities in Lithuania in contemporary society. The analysis is based on ethnographic research conducted by the author between 2015 and 2025. The study investigates both newly introduced holidays and adaptations of traditional Lithuanian festivities within a modern sociocultural context, focusing on exploring the creativity of Lithuanian modern pagan traditions, particularly the observance of the spring and autumn equinoxes. The paper highlights how individual initiatives and socio-cultural factors shape the evolution of these traditions. It also looks at the creative reinterpretation of rituals to illustrate how communities preserve and transform their heritage. Additionally, the dissemination of these traditions to the broader society is presented, revealing a dynamic interplay between nostalgia for ancient pre-Christian practices and contemporary expressions of identity within modern Lithuanian paganism.

**Minority Identity in Baltic Literature and Film** (Podcast)
By: Baltic Ways
This episode of the Baltic Ways podcast welcomes Dr. Liina-Ly Roos, assistant professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison in the German, Nordic, Slavic+ department. The discussion centers on Liina-Ly’s recent book: The Not-Quite Child: Colonial Histories, Racialization, and Swedish Exceptionalism (University of Washington Press, 2025), in which she analyzes films and literature that portray Indigenous Sámi, Tornedalian, and Finnish-speaking children and how these figures disrupt the normative understanding of growing up in Sweden. These cultural texts are filled with tensions of assimilation, invisibility, and the struggle to grow in a society that demands conformity to a specific “Swedishness.” The discussion also considers parallels to the Baltic context. Dr. Roos is a graduate of the University of Washington and a grant recipient from the Association for the Advancement of Baltic Studies.

*Acta Academiae Artium Vilnensis*, Vol. 118 (2025): "The Art–Labour Relationship in Contemporary Art ", edited by Lina Michelkevičė, Edgaras Gerasimovičius.
This issue of Acta Academiae Artium Vilnensis is dedicated to exploring the concept of the artistic labour in contemporary art. Its premise emerged from observing the transformations in this field over recent decades—changes that began with the fall of the Iron Curtain and the restoration of democratic systems in Central and Eastern Europe. The countries of the former Eastern Bloc, particularly those once part of the USSR, rushed to adopt Western art practices and to reintegrate themselves into an art history from which they had long been excluded by the control and censorship of the now-collapsed regimes. New artistic forms and strategies flourished: performance, installation, interventions in public space, collaborative practices, and media art. Conceptual approaches and organizational capacities gained increasing importance, at times even overshadowing traditional artistic skills. Labour—one of the most politicized and tightly regulated themes in socialist visual culture—again became a central axis of artistic practice for some, who sought to reflect the shifting economic, political, and social realities.

Latvian writer  Nora Ikstena dies after suffering a serious illness, aged 56.

"The Year of Protests" — that is how the past year was [labeled by editors LRT](https://www.lrt.lt/en/news-in-english/19/2790089/2025-in-lrt-photos-a-year-of-protests), the national broadcaster which itself remains at the center of heated legislative debates.
