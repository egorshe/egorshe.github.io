<summary>About</summary>
This collected volume offers an original perspective on the Baltic region by examining the intricate relationships between its diverse ethnic groups from the mid-nineteenth century to the present. Rather than focusing solely on national narratives or comparisons of historical development, the book analyzes ethnic relations through the lenses of identity, governance, empire, and violence. The nearly constant redrawing of geographic borders and boundaries among communities during this period destabilized fixed identities, generating novel, hybrid ways of self-identification along with a hardening of oppositions. Innovative forms of coexistence came with violent, sometimes genocidal conflicts. The contributors explore topics such as evolving senses of belonging, the impact of imperial and Soviet rule, instances of cooperation and conflict, and the legacies of historical trauma. By incorporating new sources and interdisciplinary approaches, they update traditional understandings of nations and nationalism in the Baltic region and provide insights relevant to similar regions.

<summary>About</summary>
Political changes in Central and Eastern Europe in the 1990s led to important territorial changes and confronted decision-makers and international lawyers with complex questions relevant to State continuity and succession. The case of the Baltic States was particularly difficult since they re-emerged after half-a-century of Soviet occupation. In addition to questions on the status of new States, important issues arose with regard to the fate of nationals of the former federations, generating frantic international efforts in developing and consolidating available rules and principles on nationality in situations of territorial change. In this context, the Baltic case stood apart. It raised questions of non-recognition of consequences of their illegal occupation in international law, but that was not the way the issues were dealt with.  
The book documents and examines the story of the Soviet occupation of the Baltic States in 1940 and their claim to State continuity fifty years later. It brings in the issue of the obligations of Russia in this context. The book asks the question what nationality solutions had to be adopted in the region and shows the scrutiny they received from international institutions. This second edition of the book revisits decisions that were taken in the 1990s and asks whether they have withstood the test of time. The case of the Baltic States is an example of the strength of international law rules, when applied with courage, and of the risks, when too many compromises with rules and principles are accepted. Although the book is specific in its coverage, it is of general importance because it draws conclusions concerning developments in law and practice which are relevant for a better understanding and regulation of statehood and nationality in international law.

<summary>Abstract</summary> 
This article examines the processes of de-Sovietization of public spaces in Lithuania, focusing on the visual transformation of monuments after the collapse of the Soviet Union. While scholarship has primarily analyzed the dismantling of Soviet monuments as acts of iconoclasm, this study argues that de-Sovietization is a dual process involving both negative and positive dimensions: the removal of Soviet-era symbols and the creation of new monuments that articulate a post-Soviet national narrative. Drawing on Jacques Rancière’s framework of artistic regimes, the article explores how newly constructed or restored monuments embody the search for a new symbolic language of political and social communication. The analysis is based on qualitative content analysis of expert interviews with sculptors, architects, and artists involved in monument-making in Lithuania since 1990. Over the past three decades, more than 400 monuments have been erected in Lithuania, reflecting the tensions between continuity and rupture with Soviet monumentalism. While naturalistic monuments often avoided controversy, projects departing from realistic aesthetics—such as Regimantas Midvikis’ Exploded Bunker and Andrius Labašauskas’ Freedom Hill—became sites of conflict and public debate. By identifying the visual features of positive de-Sovietization, the article contributes to understanding how post-Soviet societies negotiate historical memory, identity, and aesthetic form in public space.

<summary>Abstract</summary>
 The objective of this article is to document the evolution of Latvia’s discotheque movement from 1973 to 1983 in the context of the evolving Soviet youth recreational politics of late socialism. In the Soviet Union, Latvia was a pioneer in this movement. This article analyzes the development of discotheques using Pierre Bourdieu’s conceptual instruments of field, habitus, and capital. Discotheques evolved in a field in the Bourdesian sense and achieved a certain degree of autonomy during the period in question. The ideological and bureaucratic demands of the authorities became increasingly stringent by the conclusion of the decade, but the autonomy of discotheques endured.

**Hackmann, Jörg.** “North, East or Something Else? Locating the Baltic Sea Region on the Mental Maps of Europe.” _Nordiques_, vol. 47, 2025. [doi](https://doi.org/10.4000/1432n).
<details markdown="1">
<summary>Abstract</summary>
There are various spatial and historical concepts of Northern and Eastern Europe, and – not least – of the Baltic Sea Region. Debates on mental maps have already shown that such notions are neither based solely on physical geography nor on clearly delimitated historical units. Instead, the concepts are often overlapping, and partly also contrary to each other, they are differing according to languages, and in addition changing over time. Thus, such debates about the spatial division of Europe (and beyond) emerge first of all from political, social, and cultural imaginaries. Furthermore, they are as almost every social and cultural phenomenon transnationally entangled and depend on political, social, and cultural settings as well as on epochs and perspectives. This text focuses on epistemological and political concepts connected to Baltic and Nordic spaces and their trajectories, in particular since the 19th century. It starts with the changing notions of, first, the European “North” and “East”, and, second, the “Baltic” region. In the following sections, the fluidity of “Baltic” space is presented and discussed in its relations to concepts of “Nordic” space. Furthermore, other scholarly and political or cultural notions that refer to the wider Baltic Sea region or to parts of it, as for instance Baltoscandia or North-Eastern Europe, are addressed. Main theses developed in this text are, first, that concepts of “Baltic” space do not exclusively refer to the “three Baltic States” and, second, that notions referring to “Baltic” or “Nordic” are closely intertwined in the 20th and 21st centuries. Third, in recent debates “Baltic” space – in distinction to “Norden” – is based less on the region’s cultural, social, or political homogeneity, but encompasses a focus on the issue of unity in diversity within the societies of the Baltic Sea region.
