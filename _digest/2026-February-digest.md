## Publications 📚

Oppermann, Paula A.. *Thunder Cross: Fascist Antisemitism in Twentieth-century Latvia*. University of Wisconsin Press, 2026.  
[link](https://uwpress.wisc.edu/Books/T/Thunder-Cross)   
[Podcast on the book](https://newbooksnetwork.com/thunder-cross)  
<details markdown="1"><summary>Annotation</summary>
Founded in 1932, Thunder Cross (Pērkonkrusts) was the largest and most prominent right-wing political party in Latvia in the early twentieth century. Its motto—“Latvia for Latvians!”—echoed the ultranationalist rhetoric of similar movements throughout Europe at the time. Unlike the Nazis in Germany or the Fascists in Italy, however, Thunder Cross never succeeded in seizing power. Nevertheless, Holocaust historian Paula A. Oppermann argues, its movement left an indelible mark on the country. The antisemitism at the core of Thunder Cross’s ideology remained a driving force for Latvian fascists throughout the twentieth century, persisting despite shifting historical and political contexts.

Thunder Cross is the most comprehensive study of Latvia’s fascist movement in English to date, and the only work that investigates the often neglected continuities of fascist antisemitism after World War II. Formulated as an empirical case study, this book draws on international and interdisciplinary secondary literature and sources in seven languages to broaden our understanding of fascism, antisemitism, and mass violence from Germany and Italy to the larger European context.

Nuhums Kulibali, Žulijens. "In the Name of the Army of Lovers: Saying Farewell to Rosa Von Praunheim." *Kino Raksti*, February 4, 2026  
[link](www.kinoraksti.lv/petijumi/personiba/miletaju-armijas-varda-no-rozas-fon-praunheima-atvadoties-1441).
<details markdown="1"><summary>Abstract</summary>
“Farewell to you, Roza, I write this in January 2026 — much like in Kārlis Vērdiņš’s poem, I have been everywhere, visited everywhere, yet thought of you the whole time. At the 2025 Annecy Film Festival, Andrejs Brīvuļis’s queer animated short Purity was screened, while Inna Djeri, at the Riga City Council meeting on January 14, 2026, discussing funding for the film program Purely Queer that I curated, asked from the podium: ‘Queer — is that culture as we understand it?’ Nearly fifty years later, I realize that the questions you raise in Army of Lovers remain relevant. There are still those who simply must be left alone; the word ‘activist’ is still uttered with a faint smirk — still, still. And yet, Roza, forgive them, for they do not know what they are doing (including the widely known fact that Eisenstein, too, had a relationship with a man). We, the ones who remain, will be the army of lovers.” (Žulijens Nuhums Kulibali's FB)

Lavrinec, Pavel. "Lev Karsavin and the Russian-speaking Community in Interwar Lithuania." *Studies in East European Thought*, 22 January 2026  
[link](10.1007/s11212-025-09821-y).
<details markdown="1"><summary>Abstract</summary>
This study, based on both unpublished and published archival documents, periodicals, and other sources, compiles information about the interaction between Russian philosopher and historian Lev Karsavin and the Russian community in Kaunas. Between 1928 and 1940, while living in Kaunas and working at the University of Lithuania, which was renamed Vytautas Magnus University in 1930, Karsavin clearly interacted not only with his Russian colleagues at the university. His circle of friends included ballet critic Vera Sotnikova, art historian Nikolai Vorobyov, teachers at the Russian gymnasium, among others. The scholar repeatedly gave public lectures to Russian-speaking audiences. He participated in meetings of the Russian Christian Youth Circle and was a trustee of the Russian Student Corporation. This study allows us to draw several conclusions. First, during his first year in Lithuania, Karsavin sought to find listeners outside of university lecture halls. As he became more integrated into the Lithuanian academic environment, the need to communicate with Russian-speaking audiences diminished, with the exception of his circle of acquaintances, who shared similar educational backgrounds and interests. Second, some of his public appearances appear to have been part of his commitment to popularizing Eurasianism, which was also of interest to the local public.

<details markdown="1"><summary>Abstract</summary>
January 17th of this year marked the 100th anniversary of the birth of documentary film director and screenwriter Herz Frank (1926–2013). This will not be a comprehensive look at Frank's entire body of work, but rather an insight into a specific aspect that became increasingly prominent in his films starting in the 1980s: a captured, participatory involvement in his own films and a personal narrative that culminated in his self-portrait/confession, Flashback (2002).

<details markdown="1"><summary>Abstract</summary>
the poster as the genre of graphic arts is a medium where the representation of the human body functions as an important semiotic sign. this genre has also reflected and influenced the most diverse spectrum of artistic, social and political processes. in addition to informative and illustrative content, the inclusion of the human body in the composition of the poster has always had ideological purpose. the aim of this paper is to discuss how political ideology integrates the images of the human body in the posters and how it contradicts the individuals' personal feelings and bodily experiences. the case study of two categories of posters from the soviet period (1950s – 1980s) indicates the ideological strategies of sports promotion posters and anti-alcoholism propaganda posters. political propaganda posters, including sports posters, reveal the body politics of the communist ideology: to create a uniform, disciplined, desexualised, masculine bodies capable of embodying the image of the "new soviet hero". i suggest that the main artistic tendencies of the so-called "harsh style" that evolved in latvian painting at the time can be seen in the sports posters of this period. anti - alcoholism posters tend to employ a cartoon aesthetic. this tradition has its roots in the mass propaganda of the russian revolution (1917), which encouraged the emergence of extreme dichotomies in visual communication. these posters show the human body as a ridiculous and weak object that deserves to be condemned by family members, friends and all society. in this communication programme, alcoholism is not presented as a disease and a global problem of soviet society, but as a "bad choice" of individuals. the research is based on archival studies of soviet posters from the institute of art history of the art academy of latvia. complex research methods have been applied, including iconography, semiotics, contextual and comparative analysis.
