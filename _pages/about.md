    <p>My name is Egor Shmonin.
    I am a PhD candidate in the Film and Moving Image Studies program at Concordia University in Montreal.</p>
    <p>I work at the intersection of visual culture and the history of media practices, with a focus on late-20th-century documentary cinema in the Baltic region. My research examines the aesthetic apparatuses that shape Baltic imaginaries and the forms of sensitivity they produce. This site gathers traces of my work — notes, materials, and ongoing projects, both my own and those I engage with.</p>

Besides, I take photographs for myself, design posters for others, and cook for whoever comes to my place, which I prefer to leave entirely undocumented. I'm generally grumpy toward the world and harshly sarcastic toward myself.
